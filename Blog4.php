            <p>Accordingly, as you can see, the feature-focused product description tells what the product can do, while
                the benefit-focused description is more about highlighting how this purchase can improve the buyer's
                life or experience in general.</p>
            <p>But focusing on benefits doesn't mean eliminating features. Instead, each highlighted feature should

            <p>Depending on your brand voice or how you want your consumers to interact with your product, you can
                always experiment with your content writing style. It is not necessary to write only in paragraphs. You

                                easily scannable, you can go for bullet points. </h3>

                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Product descriptions written in bullet points are particularly considered best for complex products like
                electronics (smartphones, laptops, headphones), appliances (vacuum cleaners, blenders, air
                conditioners), and apparel (clothing with specific features like water resistance and breathability),
                cosmetics & personal care (products with various ingredients and benefits). </p>
            <p>This is because they have extensive and intricate feature details, and writing in bullet points makes it
                easier for users to scan and retain their key benefits and features. </p>
            <p>Also, according to the <a href='https://www.nngroup.com/articles/applying-writing-guidelines-web-pages/'
                    rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>research</a>, people prefer scanning content on the website than
                reading word by word, further highlighting the importance of writing clear and concise copies for
                complex products. Let's look at the example that illustrates the power of bullet points.</p>

            <p>When you weave a story to express how your brand came into existence, what the product means to you, or
                how you perceive your brand identity, you connect with your buyers emotionally, which may eventually
                persuade them to click the 'BUY' button.</p>
            <p class='pb-3'>Moreover, product descriptions written with a storyline are mainly considered best for
                products having an emotional connection, like Jewelry, personalized items, baby products, and luxury
                goods. You can also view this writing style for unique products such as handmade goods and sustainable

                                Necessary in Product Entry and Categorization?</h3>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>We asked the same question to our content specialists, and they believe that reviews are the most
                underrated element in product descriptions but are equally powerful. To support their claim, they
                pointed out a study that indicated around <a
                    href='https://www.brightlocal.com/research/local-consumer-review-survey/?SSAID=314743&SSCID=81k3_nrddv'
                    target='_blank' rel='nofollow'> 78%</a> of online buyers trust reviews as much as any other personal
                recommendations. </p>
            <p>So, basically, social proof is a sign revealing to your buyers that you are trustworthy. They tell your
                customers that you are not the only one who thinks these products are worth spending money on.</p>
            <p>But by social proof, we do not mean only ratings but everything that your consumers appreciate about your
                product. Right from your product winning an award or getting featured in the press to your customers
                posting its pictures and telling people how satisfied they are with this purchase. </p>

            <h2 class='text-dark blog-defaulth2 pt-5'>Your Product Description Is Just Not About Humans - Robots Read
                Too </h2>
            <p>If you do not know already, you will be surprised to know that your product descriptions give you a great
                opportunity, or let's say they play a critical role in making your website rank higher on search engine
                results pages (SERPs). </p>
            <p>All you need to do is sprinkle some relevant keywords in your product descriptions. </p>
            <p>So, keywords are the words your potential buyers type in the Google search bar when shopping online. They
                are also the words that act as flags that help search engines understand what your content or page is
                all about. </p>
            <p>Hence, next time when you write any product description, try using keywords. Now, what kind of keywords
                should you use? </p>
            <p>We recommend long-tail keywords for two reasons: </p>
            <p>One, they have lower competition, giving you better chances of ranking higher in SERPs.</p>
            <p>Second, they are super specific in nature and get searched by only serious buyers. For example, a
                long-tail keyword like waterproof hiking boots for women with wide calves will only be searched by those
                customers who are in the final stage of their search or have fully made up their minds about the product
                they want. This brings more conversion rates. </p>
            <p>But in no case should you force keywords. Use only when it comes naturally or goes well with the rest of
                the copy. </p>
