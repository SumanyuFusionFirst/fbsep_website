Understanding recruitment process outsourcing providers and their fit into your HR strategy are essential to selecting the ideal provider. </p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>1.Benefits of outsourcing the recruitment process:</h2> <ul class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <li> <p> <b>Boost the quality of your hires:</b> As part of an RPO team, your employees know how things work and how to find people who fit in well. Recruitment Process Outsourcing Services teams are industry specialists with broad networks and sourcing knowledge, ensuring access to the top personnel, even in challenging markets and continuous talent pipelines. </p></li><li> <p> <b>Boost the effectiveness of your recruitment:</b> All permanent recruitment activity is centralized and managed by the provider in an RPO. Your HR personnel will then focus on other business goals due to this. </p></li><li> <p> <b>Strategy:</b> Your resourcing strategy is tailored to your immediate, medium, and long-term demands according to workforce planning, a dedicated account team, and data-driven solutions. RPO recruitment also has access to hundreds of various datasets, which can assist you in making data-driven decisions. </p></li><li> <p> <b>Candidates have a better experience:</b> Candidates are bought into your culture when they go through a consistent, simplified candidate journey guided by a team that knows your brand and values, which reduces talent churn and ensures you have the first pick for top talent. </p></li><li> <p> <b>Cost-cutting:</b> Whether it’s through high direct delivery, supply chain rationalization, minimizing talent attrition, or delivering strategic cost-cutting initiatives, RPO Services solutions are designed to save money and increase productivity. </p></li></ul> <img src='https://www.fusionfirst.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/center-blog-image21092022.jpg' class='img-fluid ' alt='various kinds of Recruitment Process Outsourcing solutions'> <h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>2.What are the various kinds of RPO solutions?</h2> <p>RPO refers to the whole or partial recruitment process outsourcing of your permanent recruitment, with you having some control over the scope. There are a few popular models, though:</p><ul class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <li> <p> Outsourcing of the recruitment process. Outsource your permanent recruitment process from start to finish. </p></li><li> <p> RPO (Recruitment Outsourcing Services ) is a project that I’m recently handling. Project RPO is designed for fixed campaigns or projects. It provides the RPO benefits – professional consultants, streamlined processes, and superior candidate management – temporarily or for a set number of roles and jobs. </p></li><li> <p> On-Demand Recruitment Permanent staffing scales up to match demand peaks and troughs, generally through an outside workforce. Recruitment on Demand might also entail ‘loaning’ a recruitment specialist for a set amount of time to advise on your processes and help you develop your ideal recruitment service. </p></li><li> <p> Talent Acquisition as a Whole. This combines RPO and MSP (managed service providers) to give a comprehensive solution for your permanent and contract staffing needs from a single source. </p></li></ul> <p>Some companies prefer to break down their needs and engage with various specialists. A company may separate, for example, its technology requirements from its financial requirements or its CEO search requirements from its high-volume roles. Specific programs, such as graduate recruitment, may be kept in-house by some companies.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>3.How do you pick the most acceptable outsourcing partner for your recruitment process?</h2> <p>When selecting a Recruitment Process Outsourcing partner for the first time, several factors are to consider. These are some of them:</p><ul class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <li> <p> <b>Size and scalability are important considerations.</b> Smaller firms are more likely to provide you with personalized, specialized services. In contrast, larger businesses offer the security and scalability to keep up with your changing needs, such as expanding your service or entering new markets. You want a provider large enough to cope with your needs but small enough to care for. </p></li><li> <p> <b>Specialism.</b> Some RPOs will specialize in specific industries to provide additional expertise in complicated or competitive markets, such as STEM. If your requirements are extensive, you may not need to hire an expert, but if you have any difficult-to-fill criteria, a specialist may be able to assist you. </p></li><li> <p> <b>Cultural compatibility.</b> RPOs are true partnerships; these are the people you’ll be working with every day and trusting to carry out your strategy, so make sure your values, culture, and approach are in sync. </p></li><li> <p> <b>Extensive experience.</b> Always get instances of the outsourced recruitment support services provider’s work with a company similar to yours in size or industry. Case studies are a good sign of what the RPO sourcing service can achieve for you, and evidence in areas that matter to you – like inclusion and diversity or stakeholder management – may give you peace of mind. </p></li></ul> <p>To conclude, the resourcing landscape is highly adaptable. In theory, you should be able to come up with any talent acquisition strategy that works for you. Nothing prevents you from only outsourcing a portion of your resourcing service, appointing different specialists to manage various aspects of the lifecycle, or having a core internal team with an outsourced engine for volume needs. That is why it is critical to choose a provider who will create a tailored solution that wraps around your unique needs – rather than trying to fit your bespoke needs into their preferred model!</p></div></article> </div></div></div></div></div><div class='col-md-12 text-center'> <h4 class='font-weight-semibold mb-2 pb-1 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible'> Share this Post</h4></div><div class='share-buttons-container'> <div class='share-list'> <a class='fb-h' onclick='return fbs_click()' target='_blank' title='FACEBOOK'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/facebook-f.png'> </a> <a class='tw-h' onclick='return tbs_click()' target='_blank' title='TWITTER'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/twitter-squared.png'> </a> <a class='li-h' onclick='return lbs_click()' target='_blank' title='LINKEDIN'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/linkedin.png'> </a> <a data-pin-do='buttonPin' data-pin-config='none' class='pi-h' onclick='return pbs_click()' target='_blank' title='PINTEREST'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/90/000000/pinterest.png'> </a> </div></div>",

Their work productivity is affected by insufficient rest, significantly affecting their healthcare practice.</p><p>The blog mentions all the necessary information on how healthcare providers improve the patient’s experience by outsourcing to a healthcare BPO service provider.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>1.Why Does Patient Satisfaction Matter So Much?</h2> <p>Healthcare providers strive to increase patient satisfaction and experience while meeting financial goals. Patient experience has emerged as a critical differentiator for the success of healthcare providers. Excellent experiences increase the likelihood that patients will return and refer others to your healthcare facility.</p><p>In contrast, if people are unhappy with your service, they will visit your competitor and leave unfavorable reviews about your practice on numerous social media platforms. On the other hand, loyal patients will support your brand and aid in growing your sales and profitability. So, to enhance your brand’s reputation, focus on patient happiness for patient experience improvement.</p><p>Research shows that 51% of patients said they would visit another doctor if offered superior patient care. Simply looking at this figure demonstrates how crucial it is to provide excellent patient or customer service to enhance the patient’s experience. It is now appropriate to start considering and acting on this information.</p><p>Seven ways in which a healthcare BPO service provider helps to improve your patient’s customer experience</p><img src='https://www.fusionfirst.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/center-blog-44.jpg' class='img-fluid ' alt='healthcare BPO service provider improve your patient’s customer experience'> <h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>2.Eliminate Errors</h2> <p>In the healthcare sector, even the most minor errors can have a negative impact, and that too can be found in a patient’s medical records. The patient records will stay accurate and secure if you outsource to a healthcare BPO service provider that complies with ISO 27001. It also helps to prevent costly medical billing disputes, which are typically common because billing laws and rules constantly change.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>3.Focus on core business</h2> <p>By outsourcing healthcare BPO services, you can focus on enhancing patient experience in healthcare by diverting your attention from non-core business activities. It enables healthcare organizations to reduce interruptions and concentrate on their core competencies. As a result, the quality of patient care and healthcare standards rises, which boosts the organization’s reputation in the healthcare industry.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>4.Access to Skilled Professionals</h2> <p>Access to skilled healthcare professionals with deep knowledge and expertise is one of the most important benefits of outsourcing to a healthcare BPO service provider. It ensures that the patient’s requests are met feasibly without creating administrative challenges. Healthcare BPO service providers handle everything, due to which the healthcare providers will save a ton of time when it comes to employing staff.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>5. Higher task accuracy</h2> <p>Errors can result in high costs for the healthcare sector. If a healthcare organization hires experts to handle its administrative tasks, it can significantly reduce the frequency of errors. A trustworthy healthcare BPO service provider offers various services, including data processing, input, analysis, transformation, information extraction, and product information management.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>6. Focus on expanding practice offerings</h2> <p>In addition to boosting competitive advantage, outsourcing a healthcare BPO service provider provides healthcare organizations with business operations from a global perspective. Due to their highly standardized procedures, healthcare organizations offer their patients additional services.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>7. Simplify the billing process</h2> <p>Simplifying your healthcare billing process enables patients to pay the bills quickly. Better transparency and higher patient satisfaction result when a healthcare BPO service provider provides a precise cost estimate and explains the various components in the invoice. Happy patients are significantly more likely to pay their bills on time.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>8. Protect Patient Information</h2> <p>Every healthcare organization must protect the patient’s information under various compliances. Failing to do so can lead to significant fines. However, with an ISO 27001 healthcare BPO service provider, it becomes possible to maintain the patient’s information for a better patient experience.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'> Conclusion:</h2> <p>The patient experience tips mentioned above need to be followed with the help of outsourcing healthcare BPO services.

Companies that specialize in answering client inquiries received by email, chat, phone, social media, and other channels are known as Customer Service (BPOs) or Business Processing Outsourcers. You can either build your team in-house or outsource it to experts. </p><p>Excellent client service BPO can assist your firm in gaining such loyalty while also saving you money. Most significantly, partnering with a high-quality BPO will relieve you and your team of the burden of customer service, allowing you and your team to focus on other vital strategic matters such as your product or service or your vision.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>1.Why You Need Outsourced Customer Service Assistance?</h2> <p>Regardless of your industry, you must provide excellent customer service whenever your customers need help. Clients in the B2B and B2C industry are a great example and unique in that they anticipate a helpful and friendly experience every time they connect with the business. Therefore, so many B2B and B2C companies have outsourced their customer service departments.</p><p>Why outsource? A customer service center’s sole purpose is to communicate with your customers when you hire them. They have a single focus and excel at it. Companies that attempt to set up their own in-house contact center, frequently fail.</p><p>An outsourced center is solely concerned with pleasing your customers. They are well-versed in the most recent technologies used in high-quality contact centers and can implement those which work best for your customers. They understand how to hire the right people and provide excellent training. Outsourcing saves you money — and your brand’s reputation — in the long run.</p><img src='https://www.fusionfirst.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/blogsanjay.jpg' class='img-fluid ' alt='Benefits of Customer Service Business Process Outsourcing'> <h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>2.Benefits of Customer Service BPO:</h2> <ul class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <li> <p> <b>Access specialized expertise:</b> BPOs are experts in managing the scope of customer service teams. This means that they understand important customer service metrics. As your team grows, you must track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as the first contact, resolution, response time, full resolution time, customer satisfaction and more. If your performance does not meet your objectives, you must investigate and act.An outsourcer can manage all of this on your behalf. </p></li><li> <p> <b>Get the best Assistant:</b> BPO Customer Service offers access to a large pool of specialized expertise that you may not be able to find elsewhere. Our agents, for example, have an average of seven years of experience dealing with major American and European businesses. This means we get a regular stream of referrals from customer support employees who are similarly talented and experienced. </p></li><li> <p> <b>Eliminate HR headaches:</b> Managing your own customer support team demands qualified staff as well as the headaches that come with it. They must hire and train support agents, as well as organize their remuneration, monitor their performance, and deal with turnover and other concerns. They must also set up the infrastructure and technology to handle client issues. </p></li><li> <p> <b>Gain flexibility:</b> An outsourcing firm can also manage a variety of channels, including phone, email, social media, and live chat. During peak seasons, a BPO increases your capacity to hire and support personnel. We scale teams by adding a new agent every week at peak times. According to the call of our consumers, our agents provide coverage in the evenings, weekends, and 24*7. </p></li><li> <p> <b>Reduce costs:</b> Look for reliable customer service BPOs with experience of hiring top people, give outstanding training, and expand your staff as your company grows. In order to provide customer support in your home office, you’ll need equipment and space, which might be costly in bigger cities/ regions. Outsourcing can help you save money. If your customer service department uses BPO International agents based in nations with a large pool of great English-speaking talent, you can save money. But be careful: saving money does not mean sacrificing quality. </p></li></ul> <h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>3.Choose an Outsourced Customer Experience Solution With “FBSPL”</h2> <p>At FBSPL, we understand the importance of the human touch in the customer experience.

Charged as a ” rational organization of work,” it initially began with manufacturing and afterwards discovered its direction into office capacities. </p><p>But today, things have changed drastically. Customers have become the prime basis of any business.</p><p>But have you ever seen your customer base grow gradually? This means that your customers need to call the facility more often and for a longer period. You may be looking for a reliable BPO solution to help you and your business to modernize your entire customer service. For this exact reason, you should try to find a BPO company that meets your company’s requirements and objectives. Before we delve into the process of selecting the right BPO companies, let us first understand what BPO is.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>1.What Is BPO?</h2> <p>Business process outsourcing (BPO) is a well-known practice in which work and processes are delegated to professional service providers. These services may include accounting, bookkeeping, customer service, payroll, telemarketing, and social media marketing, to name a few. A BPO can be further divided into two parts: Front Office and Back Office. A company can integrate complete incoming and outgoing call center services, market research and analysis, back-office solutions, email and live chat, incoming / outgoing telemarketing, and social media monitoring to serve as a single voice for customer interaction across all channels.</p><p>BPO services have been extremely popular in recent years for several reasons. First, BPO services are provided at a low cost. It helps companies to set up their own side business so that they can make a profit from it. Trustworthy companies such as FBSPL provide high-quality services on a low budget and provide good foundation for customer support to assist them in their decision to start a BPO project.</p><img src='https://www.fusionfirst.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/blogsept2.jpg' class='img-fluid ' alt='How Does BPO Work For A Business'> <h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>2.How Does BPO Work For A Business?:</h2> <p>It is easy to understand how BPO works in a business environment. You can create a quick list of what is needed to complete the business process you are struggling with or where you need support. Once you have identified the process that takes time and prevents you from closing the deal or delighting the customers, you can go ahead with choosing your perfect outsourcing partner.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>3.What to Expect from the Right Customer Service Outsourcing Companies?:</h2> <ul class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <li> <p> <b>Deliver on Promises:</b> Many BPO companies oversell their clients and ultimately fail. The right firms won’t make promises they can’t keep. Make sure your vendor follows through all they promised. </p></li><li> <p> <b>Onboarding:</b> The project management team and procedure of your provider must be best-in-class. When outsourcing relationships aren’t set up effectively from the outset, they frequently fail. </p></li><li> <p> <b>Clear Communications:</b> The vendor should communicate openly and explicitly about your company’s objectives, expectations, culture, and obstacles. Proactive and Nimble: Expect your vendor to be adaptable and proactive while yet adhering to their procedures’ integrity. </p></li><li> <p> <b>People-Centric:</b> Vendors who disappoint frequently have a high rate of agent turnover. Client-pleasing vendors are frequently those who reinvest in their people, agent retention, sites, and culture. </p></li><li> <p> <b>No Language Barriers:</b> Client services and operational teams for the vendor must have excellent English skills as well as a thorough awareness of communication standards and tone. To provide the greatest service to your clients, agents assigned to your account must have the appropriate English aptitude and skills. </p></li><li> <p> <b>Branding:</b> Your outsourcing partner should be familiar with your brand and be able to represent it by providing a purpose and values-aligned employee and customer experience. </p></li><li> <p> <b>Quality and Compliance</b> Call quality scores must match or exceed your expectations, according to the vendor’s quality and compliance policies. The methods for training, mentoring, and employee development are excellent. </p></li></ul> <h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>4.Top Benefits of Customer Service Outsourcing: Outsourcing wisely and with the proper vendor(s) could be a profitable strategy for your business. The following are some of the most relevant advantages of outsourcing over in-house:</h2> <ul class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <li> <p> <b>Cost Savings:</b> BPOs require a lot of manpower. Recruiting, hiring, and training costs can account for 50 per cent to 80 per cent of an operation’s total costs, not to mention infrastructure and facility costs. </p></li><li> <p> <b>Increased Efficiency:</b> You may concentrate on strengthening your brand’s strengths and core competencies by outsourcing. </p></li><li> <p> <b>Scalability and Staffing Flexibility:</b> Whether it’s extended hours, 24/7 coverage, seasonal spikes, or overflow, outsourcers can staff to match shifting contact volume. </p></li><li> <p> <b>A Wide Range of Skills and Expertise:</b> Outsourcers serve a variety of industry verticals by providing clients with access to a larger talent pool from which they can draw without having to acquire or educate in-house personnel in certain specialties. </p></li><li> <p> <b>Service Quality:</b> BPO’s invest a lot of time, money, and effort into constantly developing and refining their customer experience, quality assurance, technology, tools, and procedures. </p></li></ul> <p>What was originally seen as purely a cost-cutting strategy has evolved into a substantial advantage that allows businesses to make use of talents, creativity, technology, and world-class practices that would otherwise take years to establish in-house. However, investing in the appropriate strategic alliances to help scale your organization is the best approach to prepare for and welcome expansion.</p><p>FBSPL is a rapidly expanding business outsourcing firm that provides a variety of BPO services, including data entry, data processing, Pre-Sales Support, Omni Channel, eCommerce, Accounting & Bookkeeping, Recruitment Process Outsourcing, customer support services, and more.

You might wonder how it works and why do we need to have such a system in place? Let us look at all these questions in detail. </p><p>Vendor Management System (VMS) is a platform to connect market Suppliers/Vendors with different proposals & quotations with the end user.</p><p>VMS in Recruitment/Staffing Industry refers to the processes associated with procuring and optimizing your contingent workforce with staffing agencies to receive the best value from your vendors, who offer your organization exceptional staff solutions services.</p><p class='mb-0'>It is web or internet-based, which enables you to enhance and manage your staffing solutions & services efficiently. It simplifies the complete process of sourcing and managing contingent staff.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>1. Key Features of Vendor Management System</h2> <p>There are a few key features to this system that will help you to achieve the below:</p><ul> <li>Ability to gather insightful hiring metrics</li><li>Option to onboard contingent staff members with ease</li><li>Initiate, automate, and conduct transactions</li><li>Gather data related to payroll</li></ul> <h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>2. Benefits of VMS</h2> <p>VMSs are used to manage and collate submissions from candidates. It also initiates the hiring process for temporary positions by issuing temp requirements to staffing organizations.</p><ul class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <li class='text-dark'> <h3 class='blog-defaulth2 text-4 text-dark' style='text-transform: capitalize;'> Automation</h3> </li><p>Process improvement is needed in the HR world via automation, giving more time to the recruiters so they can be way more effective in their field of expertise: searching for top talented job candidates.</p><p>A VMS brings out many opportunities for these process improvements, especially with the capacity to automate and centralize the interactions and processes between a company and the staffing agencies they work with. With the help of VMS, HR professionals have the support of a platform that gives them full viewability into the exchange of the data that flows to and from the recruitment agencies they work with. </P> <li class='text-dark'> <h3 class='blog-defaulth2 text-4 text-dark' style='text-transform: capitalize;'>Cost Effective </h3> </li><p> Staffing agencies typically ask for a markup ranging from 25% to 100% of a hired worker’s wages. A VMS is a vital tool that can help ensure accountability for staffing agencies. This gives HR professionals an online platform to measure the effectiveness of all the staffing agencies they collaborate with. Also, they can make well-informed, cost-effective decisions in determining which staffing agencies are performing and which are not very effective. </p><p> VMS systems provide other cost-saving opportunities, like giving HR professionals the ability to get and analyze perfect payroll data and helping them avoid unnecessary expenses. </P> <li class='text-dark'> <h3 class='blog-defaulth2 text-4 text-dark' style='text-transform: capitalize;'> Reporting Metrics & Risk Mitigation </h3> </li><p> A VMS system provides recruiters with a powerful resource to draw out helpful performance metrics that help you track the effectiveness of the dollars your organization is spending on the service of staffing agencies. </P> <p> It gives recruiters an easy-to-use platform to ensure that your hiring processes and the staffing agencies that you rely on continue recruiting and onboarding new talent in a manner that remains compliant with government regulations. </p><P> VMS makes the entire hiring process easier right from the requirement collection phase. Companies can add their requirements to the tool; from there, the requirements get forwarded directly to the staffing agencies. A VMS system also automates interview scheduling, job offers and billing onboarding and off-boarding activities. Hence, it becomes much easier to hire temporary, contractual, and permanent labor. </P> </ul> <h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Conclusion</h2> <p>The use of VMS makes the management of an otherwise complicated recruitment process more accessible.

It’s incredible to fathom how machines can learn and perform similarly as us humans.</p><p>While AI and ML have a long-standing history, organizations have now warmed up to their massive contribution to real-life systems. However, a majority of businesses still struggle to understand the entire concept of AI and ML to have an edge over their competitors.</p><p>Implementation of artificial intelligence in any sector requires expertise in data collection, categorization, filtering, labelling, and annotation techniques. To put your worries behind us, we’ve compiled a comprehensive guide to Data Annotation and labelling helping you learn what it is, how it is done, why it is needed, Data Annotation examples, and types of Data Annotation. Let’s dive right in!</p></div><div class='post-content ms-0 blog-default'> <h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>What is Data Annotation?</h2> <p>A large majority of data owned by organizations is unstructured and is growing manifold with each passing year. Large chunks of unstructured data floating around pose security and compliance risks. This is where Data Annotation steps in!</p><p><a target='_blank' href='<?=$baseurl2?>/data-annotation-services'>Data Annotation</a> is the cumulative process of tagging and labelling the available, unstructured data into different elements like text, images, videos, and more. When we end up labelling the data elements, it’s easy for machine learning models to accurately comprehend and process those elements even in the future when any new information is built on the existing data.</p><p>When your data is appropriately annotated and implemented, the efficiency of your AI and ML models increases automatically. Such models are perfectly ready to take up for deployment for chatbots, automation, speech recognition, and more such processes. </p></div><div class='post-content ms-0 blog-default'> <h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>What are the Differences Between Data Annotation and Data Labelling?</a></h2> <p>In the terms of <a target='_blank' href='https://www.v7labs.com/blog/machine-learning-guide' rel='nofollow'>machine learning</a>, both Data Annotation and data labelling are actually the same – the process of tagging meaningful labels to the unstructured datasets to help explain what’s inside them. Let’s look at Data Annotation vs data labelling in a different manner: </p><table class='table table-bordered'> <thead> <tr> <th> Parameter </th> <th> Data Annotation </th> <th> Data Labelling </th> </tr></thead> <tbody> <tr> <td> Overview </td><td> Data Annotation is the processing of adding relevant labels to the data to make them recognizable and understandable by machine learning models. </td><td> Data labelling is the precise process of adding additional information/metadata to existing unstructured data to help train machine learning models. </td></tr><tr> <td> Purpose </td><td> Data Annotation is a basic requirement when it comes to training different machine learning models. </td><td> Data labelling serves the purpose of identifying relevant features in a particular dataset. </td></tr><tr> <td> Benefit </td><td> Data Annotation benefits by helping in recognizing relevant data. </td><td> Data labelling benefits in recognizing the patterns to help train ML algorithms and models. </td></tr></tbody> </table> <h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Types of Data Annotation</h2> <p>Types of Data Annotation is a broad term encapsulating multiple Data Annotation examples, such as image, text, video, audio, and more. For a clear understanding, we’ve fragmented them individually. Let’s learn different Data Annotation examples and types:</p><ul class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <li><b>Image Annotation</b></li><p>Image annotation is a crucial technique in modules concerning facial recognition, computer vision, robotics, and more. AI experts add labels such as captions, identifiers, attributes, tags, and keywords inside the image to make it easier for robotics to comprehend the visual information. The techniques used in image annotation include bounding boxes, line annotation, 3D cuboids, and landmark annotation.</p><li><b>Text Annotation</b></li><p>Text data comes with a lot of semantics and contrast to images and videos that convey a straightforward intention. Text-based data could be anything, ranging from customer feedback on the app/website to a social media mention. While humans are attuned to understanding the context, relatability, conversation, and meaning behind a text, machines are unable to do so.</p><p>Abstract elements in data like sarcasm, humour, and emotion are an unknown territory for machines, which is why text annotation is further staged in a more refined manner:</p><ul class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <li>Semantic Annotation</li><li>Intent Annotation</li><li>Text Categorization</li><li>Named Entity Annotation</li><li>Relation Annotation</li></ul> <li><b>Audio Annotation</b></li><p>Audio annotation is the process of timestamping, audio labelling, and transcribing speech data. Audio annotation, being an umbrella technique, covers speech transcription, pronunciation, and going a mile further by identifying the speaker's dialect, demographics, and language.</p><li><b>Video Annotation</b></li><p>Video annotation is a process involving the addition of key points, bounding boxes, and polygons to annotate or label different objects in each video frame. For the unversed, video is a compilation of different images creating the effect of being in motion, and each image in the moving video is referred to as a frame. Video annotation helps in localization, object tracking, and motion blur in different systems.</p></ul> <h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Data Annotation Use Cases</h2><img src='<?=$baseurl?>/img/DataAnnotationUsesInfographic.webp' class='img-fluid mb-4' alt='Data Annotation Use Cases' style='display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; width: 60%;'><ul class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <li><b>Enhanced Search Engine Results</b></li><p>Building your website and putting it on the search engines like Google or Bing is challenging since millions of websites and pages already exist. Google uses, recognizes, and favours annotated files to help expedite the regular updating of its servers.</p><p>When fed to the search engines, data sets with appropriate Data Annotation help improve the quality of the search results. Data Annotation makes it easier to fetch customized search results of a user’s query based on the user history, gender, age, demographics, and more. </p><li><b>Creation of Facial Recognition Software</b></li><p>Using landmark annotation in image annotation, machines are empowered to identify specific facial markers such as the nose, shape of the eyes, face length, and more. Such facial recognition pointers are then stored in a computer database to help identify them if the face comes into sight later.</p><p>This technology has empowered leading tech companies like Samsung and Apple to build face lock software in their phones and computer devices to improve their security and accessibility.</p><li><b>Data Creation for Self-Driving Cars</b></li><p>Companies like Tesla has harnessed the power of Data Annotation (image annotation precisely) to build semi-autonomous cars that drive by themselves, identify markers on the road, stay within the lane, and improve interaction with the drivers. Bounding boxes, 3D cuboids, and semantic segmentation techniques are used in creating Tesla for lane detection, collection, and identification of objects.</p><li><b>Advancements in Medical Sector</b></li><p>New technology and breakthrough advancements in the healthcare sector are largely based on artificial intelligence. Data Annotation comes across as a robust technique in neurology and pathology to pick up patterns in helping to make an accurate and quick diagnosis. Doctors can now identify malignant cells and cancerous tumours that are challenging to identify visually.</p></ul> <h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Final Thoughts</h2> <p>Data Annotation types and use play a catalyst in the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Unfortunately not every company has enough funds to take care of all these things. At this point, you need to hire a business process consultant to manage your finance, accounting, and other unproductive tasks at best. Before delegating your accounting or bookkeeping needs to a third party, you need to ask some security-related questions.</p><p>In order to protect your business and calm your worries, it is crucial to know what questions to ask to assure your data is safe and protected. Here are a few to help you get started with accounting outsourcing companies:</p></div><div class='post-content ms-0 blog-default'> <h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>What do Physical Security Measures Use?</h2> <p>Before checking the safety of your electronic data, you must check if the servers and other areas where your financial data is stored, is highly secured or not. Ask the offshore agency about the type of access their experts have to databases and whether they have secured server room or not. Besides, you need to check if there are appropriate security measures that serve to screen operators who access the database. If the offshore company has remote staff, check if there are industry standards to manage the location and distribution of data. You will also need to assure that your financial information does not leave the premises of the virtual assistant service provider.</p></div><div class='post-content ms-0 blog-default'> <h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>What Happens to the Files When They are Finished with them?</h2> <p>Once the virtual assistant service provider finishes work on your accounting or bookkeeping, what will they do with the used or older file? Do they save older files for a short period of time or erase the files after providing you with copies? After the fulfillment of the work, will the files be downloaded or made accessible through an FTP? You must ask for a written statement on what will happen to your older files. This will help you safeguard your financial data for the future.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>What are Their Policies in Case of a Data Breach?</h2> <p>You should always go with an offshore agency that has an emergency action plan in place if an emergency occurs. Ask them what exactly will happen if your confidential files are stolen or the servers are endangered. What policies and emergency plans do the company have in place to lessen the damage, recover information and remunerate the affected organization? Moreover, you must check out their alert process. When will emergency measures be taken to protect your data? This will help you plan a proper strategy in case of any security breach in advance.</p><p>All these significant questions must be asked before choosing any virtual assistance services as you will be transferring a massive amount of sensitive financial data to a third party. If you are still confused regarding your bookkeeping and financial needs, we will help you get them sorted. We as the best outsourcing companies in the USA strive to deliver the most innovative business solution to our global clients.</p><p><a href='<?=$baseurl2?>/book-free-consultation-call'>Book a free consultation call with the experts today!</a></p><p>Stay tuned with us for more such interesting <a href='<?=$baseurl2?>/blog'>Blogs</a>.</p></div></article> </div></div></div></div><div class='col-md-12 text-center'> <h4 class='font-weight-semibold mb-2 pb-1 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible'> Share this Post</h4></div><div class='share-buttons-container'> <div class='share-list'> <a class='fb-h' onclick='return fbs_click()' target='_blank' title='FACEBOOK'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/facebook-f.png'> </a> <a class='tw-h' onclick='return tbs_click()' target='_blank' title='TWITTER'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/twitter-squared.png'> </a> <a class='li-h' onclick='return lbs_click()' target='_blank' title='LINKEDIN'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/linkedin.png'> </a> <a data-pin-do='buttonPin' data-pin-config='none' class='pi-h' onclick='return pbs_click()' target='_blank' title='PINTEREST'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/90/000000/pinterest.png'> </a> </div></div>",

The only thing that matters is, did you leave the customers happy?</p><p>Consider it as the guiding light for customer support services and do not let it get lost between the measurable things.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Hire Customer Support Reps</h2> <p>Expert customer service executives are likely to attract customers towards the brand. It sounds complicated but works in three simple steps:</p><p>Hire the right representatives. By right reps, it means customer support associates who bring experience with them.</p><p>Introduce your product or brand to them so that they can blend their customer care skills with your brand voice.</p><p>Watch your customers returning after that. If nothing works at all, the consistent human support on the product or service-related problems will make a difference.</p><p>Thus, when you hire the right people and focus on customer relationship management, you are not losing a large chunk of customers, for sure. If you find it difficult to hire the right talent. Connect with an experienced BPO who can bring in the right blend of experience both in operations and customer support.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Create an Emotional Connection</h2> <p>It’s not what you say; it’s how you say it.</p><p>One of the best examples is of an e-commerce company who found that a customer couldn’t return newly bought pair of shoes in due time as his mother passed away. When the company found out the case, they took care of the return shipping. Not only this, they sent a bouquet and a note of condolences from the customer support team.</p><p>Yes! It does make a difference. As per the new science of customer emotions, an emotionally engaged customer is likely to respond in the following was:</p><ul class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <li> Recommend your product & service further </li><li> Become a loyal customer </li><li> Be less price-sensitive and opt repeatedly for your brand </li></ul> <p>Customers tend to become loyal when they find out that a business cares about the well-being of a customer.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Go Wherever the Customer Goes</h2> <p>Maybe a prospective customer wants to inquire about a product/service on social media, or email, or chatbox on website. Thus, it is essential for a customer support executive to provide multi-channel/Omnichannel service with the same quality and brand touch across all platforms.</p><p>And as social media becomes a famous junction for customers of every age and group, a dedicated team of customer support only for social media channels can earn you happy and loyal customers.</p><p>So, don’t shuttle them off, provide support on all the channel that they choose.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Take Customer Feedback and React</h2> <p>Every customer has a unique need and preference. After answering their questions, and solving their problems, lean on to a customer feedback session. Because there is a no absolute substitute for customer feedback in the process of improving customer experience.</p><p>But remember to keep it short and crisp!</p><p>A customer should not feel annoyed by your list of questions. And it does not end on gathering the feedback; you also must act on it.</p><p>Listen to them, act on the feedback and congratulations! You are already on the path of giving the best customer service.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>What Next?</h2> <p>Acting on the fact that customers give a lot of attention to the brand that provides the right support, a business can take it as an opportunity to stand out among the competitors.</p><p>And if you do not have an in-house team to give the best customer care, Fusion has a team of customer support associates to work for you. Being in the BPO industry for a considerable time, we have the right knowledge and team to act your customer queries no matter where they are.</p></div></article> </div></div></div></div><div class='col-md-12 text-center'> <h4 class='font-weight-semibold mb-2 pb-1 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible'> Share this Post</h4></div><div class='share-buttons-container'> <div class='share-list'> <a class='fb-h' onclick='return fbs_click()' target='_blank' title='FACEBOOK'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/facebook-f.png'> </a> <a class='tw-h' onclick='return tbs_click()' target='_blank' title='TWITTER'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/twitter-squared.png'> </a> <a class='li-h' onclick='return lbs_click()' target='_blank' title='LINKEDIN'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/linkedin.png'> </a> <a data-pin-do='buttonPin' data-pin-config='none' class='pi-h' onclick='return pbs_click()' target='_blank' title='PINTEREST'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/90/000000/pinterest.png'> </a> </div></div>",

To offset these risks, each party comes to a business agreement which should have some form of insurance coverage, but examining each policy takes time and adds the danger of important facts being ignored. These risks and responsibilities can be mitigated using insurance certificates. If a certificate of insurance is required in your day-to-day operations or project, make sure your partner provides one.</b></p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>What is a Certificate of Insurance?</h2> <p>A certificate of insurance (COI) is a one-page document outlining important information from an insurance policy. Although it is not a replacement for a genuine and original insurance policy, the COI acts as proof of insurance and proof of specific insurance coverage.</p><ul class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <li> <p>As a requirement of doing business with the insurance company, clients may request a COI. For informational purposes solely, the COI can be issued without a specific certificate holder. A COI holder may be a direct beneficiary of the insurance policy.</p></li><li> <p>The insurance coverage may provide them with only a limited or no immediate cash advantage (i.e., they want evidence of the coverage and notification if the policy is cancelled).</p></li></ul> <p></p></div><div class='post-content ms-0 blog-default'> <h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Who Needs a COI?</h2> <p>The answer to this question is contingent on the function your organisation plays in a joint venture. For example, if you own a restaurant and work with a company that supplies you with meat products, you’ll want to make sure they’re covered. What’s up with that? Because if they aren’t covered and sell you rotting meat, your insurer will have to cover all of the damages if your customers become ill and file lawsuits against you</p><p>Similarly, if your restaurant is engaged to host a function, the person or group employing you will want to know that you are insured before signing the contract and granting you the work and will most likely seek a Certificate of Insurance (COI).</p><p>The act of requesting an insurance certificate has nothing to do with trust. It’s all about limiting risk and ensuring that you’re covered if something goes wrong. Even if you trust the company with whom you’re partnering and have previously worked with them, you should still request a COI whenever you sign a new contract or agreement with them. This eliminates the possibility of you incurring unnecessary risks for the work that your partner company has been paid to do.</p><ul class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <li><p>Having a certificate of insurance can be the difference between obtaining the job and not getting the job. Each time you sign a contract with a new or existing client, you’ll need one. Simply said, it denotes the existence of your coverage.</p></li><li><p>To ensure that your insurance policy is legitimate and in existence, clients want you to supply them with a certificate of insurance. They want to know that if there are any claims, they won’t be held liable for any injuries, poor workmanship, or damages resulting from your job. Even if your client is aware of your policy, issuing a COI adds validity and professionalism to your image and that of your company.</p></li><li><p>Your clients may rest easy knowing that your insurance policy is up to date. Your customer could be held liable if you cause any damages or accidents without the certificate. You don’t want to lose your work because you are unable to show the certificate.</p></li></ul> <h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Why COI are Essential?</h2> <p>Insurance certificates are vital for you, your partners, and your consumers. Being able to offer proof of insurance as a firm that is insured makes it much easier for you to form partnerships and expand your business. Few firms or clientele nowadays are willing to partner or deal with an uninsured corporation, so being able to secure a COI when needed is critical to your company’s success.</p><p>If you’re bidding on a contract or work, the company you’re bidding on will almost always need you to submit a COI with your bid. In most circumstances, having sufficient insurance and being able to show it will offer you an advantage over other companies bidding on the same work who may not be legally covered.</p><p>There may be situations when you are the one who requests a COI from another company. If you’re a construction business that frequently employs subcontractors to collaborate with you, for example, you should ask for proof of insurance from these subcontractors. If your subcontractors make a mistake that causes damage to properties or injuries and they don’t have insurance, you could be held liable.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Three key reasons behind owning it:</h2> <ul class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <li><p><b>Serves as proof of insurance:</b></p>A COI explains the presence of the insurance policy as well as its contents. The COI assists in keeping this information organised because different vendors and contractors require different levels and types of insurance.</li><li><p><b>Saves time:</b></p>COI allows you to quickly access information contained in the insurance policy, reducing you time. A COI decreases the amount of information that must be stored and examined because many insurance policies are several pages long. It can be tricky and time-consuming to organise all of the insurance documents and make sure that each party has the necessary coverage when dealing with multiple parties. It is more efficient to store many COIs.</li><li><p><b>Reduces legal risks:</b></p>Because a loss can be passed to the third party’s insurer, having a COI reduces the risk of liability. When interacting with various contractors and suppliers, you may become subject to the specifics of their policies, as each company’s employee poses a danger of personal injury or death.</li><p>We perform regular account reviews to ensure our clients have the protection they need, but Contact Fusion Business Solution today to learn more.</p></ul> </div></article> </div></div></div></div><div class='col-md-12 text-center'> <h4 class='font-weight-semibold mb-2 pb-1 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible'> Share this Post</h4></div><div class='share-buttons-container'> <div class='share-list'> <a class='fb-h' onclick='return fbs_click()' target='_blank' title='FACEBOOK'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/facebook-f.png'> </a> <a class='tw-h' onclick='return tbs_click()' target='_blank' title='TWITTER'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/twitter-squared.png'> </a> <a class='li-h' onclick='return lbs_click()' target='_blank' title='LINKEDIN'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/linkedin.png'> </a> <a data-pin-do='buttonPin' data-pin-config='none' class='pi-h' onclick='return pbs_click()' target='_blank' title='PINTEREST'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/90/000000/pinterest.png'> </a> </div></div>",

Whether you need contract workers, have recurring projects that require expert personnel, or can’t keep up with a sizeable in-house recruitment team, you’ll need to hire more individuals at some point. It’s time to think about outsourcing your recruitment process to improve the whole recruiting process and handle your talent acquisition needs more efficiently (RPO). Many businesses are unfamiliar with the idea of RPO. So, what precisely is RPO, and what are its advantages?</p><p>RPO is the process of outsourcing all or part of a company’s sourcing of employees to a third party. Accessing the best candidates on the market is critical to competitive advantages and business performance. When deciding on a product or service, one of the first questions to ask is, “How will this help my company?” It can be worthwhile in the long and short run to select the perfect provider for their needs, one that understands their company culture, beliefs, and recruiting goals.</p><p>RPO (recruitment process outsourcing) has a lot of advantages. This is true regardless of whether you plan to outsource the entire recruitment process or just a portion of it. Here are the top five benefits of RPO:</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Defined Processes:</h2> <p>Creating your hiring team entails hiring people to conduct recruitment and creating an entire hiring process. You’ll adapt internet guidance, use the workflows in whatever applicant tracking system you employ, and tap upon the experience of the people you hire. Still, you continue to develop and ideal your entire process.</p><p>All of this has already been done by an RPO. They already have a well-defined process in place. All you have to do is enlist their assistance, and they will either work with you or entirely take over your hiring process using their own proven and effective techniques. That’s a lot of work done for you right away.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Lessen The Hiring Time:</h2> <p>The longer your hiring process takes, the more issues you’ll encounter. Suitable candidates will accept other offers before you make your own. The cost of building, filtering, and refining your candidate pool rises as the most qualified candidates lose interest or are recruited elsewhere. Because the overall quality of candidates declines, the people you hire may not be as talented as they could be, and they might be dissatisfied and more likely to leave.</p><p>In two ways, an RPO can help with all of this. For starters, they have their hiring procedures in place. More importantly, they typically have pre-built candidate pools for various industries and roles. They don’t have to start from scratch; they can begin searching for talented candidates right away.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Access to Better Tools:</h2> <p>A RPO is possibly more significant than your private venture and can bear to pay for better apparatuses. You could purchase similar appliances they use, yet it might cost you many dollars. The RPO has a wide range of clients paying them to part the expense of their devices among their clients. Those expenses are more earnestly to legitimize for a private company for the time being.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Often Specialize:</h2> <p>Some RPOs will specialize in particular areas with their own rules and regulations, such as healthcare and IT. Rather than requiring your hiring team to become experts, you offload the burden to an RPO and benefit from their knowledge.</p><p>Hiring qualified workers necessitates assessing their abilities, which can be challenging if you don’t have a team that effectively evaluates and judges such skills. An RPO will know what to seek for, what red flags to look out for, what certifications and training are most essential, and even which colleges provide a better education. This is a part of the process of putting the most incredible people in the best jobs for them and you.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Reducing Expenditures: </h2> <p>Almost all of the following benefits will impact the cost of hiring. It costs you time and money every time a procedure fails, an applicant falters in the interview stage, a skills assessment fails, or a potential recruit drops out. Worse, when it comes to hiring, time is money; thus, the less successful your hiring process is, the higher your expenditures.</p><p>RPOs do everything they can to speed up and improve your hiring process, bringing in the best-qualified individuals who are most likely to succeed in a specific position. Sure, hiring an RPO entails paying a monthly charge, but that fee is nearly always less than the expense of handling everything yourself.</p><p>To summarize, recruitment process outsourcing (RPO) is worth considering if you need to respond to changing hiring needs or look for innovative approaches to optimize talent procedures. It can be stressful to have an urgent hiring need. Understaffing can result in costly revenue loss, poor production, and low employee morale. An RPO can help you deal with expected spikes in demand and provide you with the best talent when you need it.</p><p>Stay tuned with us for more such interesting <a href='<?=$baseurl2?>/blog'>blogs</a>.</p><p>And if you are seeking a reliable recruitment process outsourcing partner, then FBSPL awaits your call <a href='<?=$baseurl2?>/book-free-consultation-call'>Book a free consultation</a> call now.</p><ul class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <li>Market research of the best vendor</li><li>Outsourcing needs analysis – partial or complete</li><li>Confidentiality and security</li><li>Free Work trial</li></ul><p><a href='<?=$baseurl2?>/contact-fbspl'>Contact us today!</a></p></div></article> </div></div></div></div><div class='col-md-12 text-center'> <h4 class='font-weight-semibold mb-2 pb-1 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible'> Share this Post</h4></div><div class='share-buttons-container'> <div class='share-list'> <a class='fb-h' onclick='return fbs_click()' target='_blank' title='FACEBOOK'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/facebook-f.png'> </a> <a class='tw-h' onclick='return tbs_click()' target='_blank' title='TWITTER'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/twitter-squared.png'> </a> <a class='li-h' onclick='return lbs_click()' target='_blank' title='LINKEDIN'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/linkedin.png'> </a> <a data-pin-do='buttonPin' data-pin-config='none' class='pi-h' onclick='return pbs_click()' target='_blank' title='PINTEREST'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/90/000000/pinterest.png'> </a> </div></div>",

Fast forward to today, and social media has evolved from a just networking channel to a holistic platform with potent marketing tools. The wealth of marketing opportunities afforded by social media is by every means far-reaching, just ask bestproducts.com who upped their number of monthly web visitors to over 600,000 all thanks to social media marketing techniques. But like social media itself, social media strategies evolve over time. Curious about what would be the rave for social media, here’s a quick sneak peek.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Mobile technologies lead the pack</h2> <p>If there’s one thing we’ve come to realize over the years, it’s the now common knowledge that mobile-based technology is slowly but steadily outranking other platforms for consumer engagement. As of October 2020, there was an estimated 4.08 billion active mobile social media users worldwide. The import from this prevailing scenario is that businesses seeking competitive advantage must up their mobile content and mobile advertising game. Companies must now invest considerable resources and time in the development of content enhanced for mobile integration, which leads to the next point.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Businesses must churn out richer content to stand out</h2> <p>The hard truth is that virtually everyone is doing social media marketing now – small companies, startup, mega businesses, you name it. And as a result, social media is currently saturated with a plethora of mundane ads targeting the increasingly ‘ads-desensitized’ social media users. If you aim to get user engagement, then you must develop richer content because after all as they say content is king. Low-level content does not generate conversions anymore; you could spend years forcing bland material down the throat of consumers, but trust us, they won’t swallow. Quality content is just as valuable (if not more important) than the actual advertisement campaign.</p><p>As far as the metrics go, for now, quality content presented as a video is what’s deriving the conversion. That said other forms of user engagement could be potentially disruptive. You just have to put on your thinking cap and get creative.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>You’ll need to put more work into your social media Campaign</h2> <p>Social media marketing is serious business, but many fail to see it that way. To some, it is just a casual way of bolstering market reach, to others it’s a promising prospect that’s too stressful to manipulate and to the sect, we like to call ‘wise’ it’s an invaluable tool that generates the majority of their business leads. Which one are you? For social media to work for your business, you have to commit considerable effort and time to your marketing strategies. And while this might seem unfeasible given your current workload, it is something that can be achieved by delegating such tasks to virtual assistants and remote staffs at a fraction of the cost it’ll take to hire an onsite team. Nothing good comes easy, and social media marketing is a case example of a tree that won’t yield fruit unless it is watered properly.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Last but not least, it’s time to delve into Influencer marketing</h2> <p>People trust opinions and suggestions if it’s coming from ‘people’ like them not from the content producers themselves. No one expects you to speak ill of your product, so anything you say about it is taken with a pinch of salt. Influencer marketing orchestrated subtly and indirectly polishes your brand with that ‘peoples favorite’ sheen.</p></div></article> </div></div></div></div><div class='col-md-12 text-center'> <h4 class='font-weight-semibold mb-2 pb-1 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible'> Share this Post</h4></div><div class='share-buttons-container'> <div class='share-list'> <a class='fb-h' onclick='return fbs_click()' target='_blank' title='FACEBOOK'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/facebook-f.png'> </a> <a class='tw-h' onclick='return tbs_click()' target='_blank' title='TWITTER'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/twitter-squared.png'> </a> <a class='li-h' onclick='return lbs_click()' target='_blank' title='LINKEDIN'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/linkedin.png'> </a> <a data-pin-do='buttonPin' data-pin-config='none' class='pi-h' onclick='return pbs_click()' target='_blank' title='PINTEREST'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/90/000000/pinterest.png'> </a> </div></div>",

Then this is a must-read! The strategies discussed in this article will not only show you how to generate leads for your accounting and bookkeeping business, but they are also proven techniques for faster, long term and budget-friendly lead generation.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Why Should You Focus on Lead Generation?</h2> <p>As an experienced <b>business process management consultant</b>, I am aware that the importance of generating leads for the growth and success of <b>accounting and bookkeeping businesses</b> cannot be underestimated as the global market grew at 13% CAGR between 2021 and 2022, and it is expected to keep growing at 11% through 2026. In today's highly competitive business world, it's essential to have a steady stream of leads to keep your business thriving and reach new audiences. Lead generation is a continuous process that requires effort and dedication. Still, with the right strategies in place, it can be a powerful tool for attracting new clients and growing your business.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>What Factors Determine the Quality of Your Leads?</h2> <p>Before discussing lead generation techniques, it's essential to understand what makes a lead high-quality.</p><p>A critical factor determining the quality of accounting leads is the relevance of the leads to the business. For example, if the business specializes in small <b>business bookkeeping</b>, it would not be beneficial to generate leads for large corporations as the business may not have the resources or expertise to meet their needs. Another important factor is the timeliness of the leads. <b>Accounting and bookkeeping services</b> are time-sensitive, and it's essential to generate leads on time to ensure that potential clients receive the services they need when they need them.</p><p>To highlight a few, the following are key factors that determine the quality of an <b>accounting lead generation</b>:</p><ul class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <li>Budget: Does the lead have the budget to invest in your services?</li><li>Authority: Does the lead have the decision-making power to invest in your services?</li><li>Need: Does the lead have a genuine need for your services?</li><li>Timing: Is the lead ready to invest in your services now, or is it a long-term consideration?</li></ul> <h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Choosing Between Inbound or Outbound</h2> <p>Regarding lead generation for an accounting and bookkeeping business, both inbound and outbound marketing approaches can be effective. However, the best approach depends on your business's specific goals and target audience.</p><p>Inbound marketing focuses on attracting potential clients to your business through valuable content and helpful resources. This approach is particularly effective for businesses that want to establish themselves as thought leaders in the industry and attract leads organically. Techniques such as content marketing, SEO, and social media marketing can be used to attract leads in a non-intrusive way.</p><p>On the other hand, outbound marketing involves actively reaching out to potential clients through techniques such as paid advertising, direct mail, and cold calling. This approach is ideal for businesses that need to generate leads quickly or have a specific target audience that can be reached through outbound channels.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Top Lead Generation Techniques</h2> <p>So, considering these two techniques, what are the top lead generation techniques for accounting and bookkeeping businesses?

One of the most effective ways to achieve these goals is by implementing a business process management (BPM) strategy.<p>BPM is a systematic approach to improving businesses' operations by identifying, analyzing, and improving the key processes that drive them. According to a recent survey, over 70% of organizations have implemented or planned to implement a BPM solution to improve their operations. In this blog, we will discuss the benefits of BPM and the top 5 reasons why you should choose a BPM consultant for your organization.<h2 class='text-dark blog-defaulth2'>Benefits of Business Process Management</h2><h3 class='text-dark text-bold'>Increased Efficiency and Productivity</h3><p>One of the <a target=_blank href='<?=$baseurl2?>/blog/why-should-you-opt-for-fbspl-as-your-business-process-outsourcing-partner'>main advantages of BPM</a> is that it helps businesses to identify and eliminate inefficiencies in their processes. By mapping out and analyzing their processes, organizations can identify bottlenecks, redundant steps, and areas that require improvement. This helps to streamline processes, reduce the time it takes to complete tasks, and ultimately increase overall efficiency and productivity.<h3 class='text-dark text-bold'>Streamlined Operations</h3><p>Another significant advantage of BPM is that it helps businesses to standardize their processes <a target=_blank href='<?=$baseurl2?>/bpm-outsourcing-services'>across different departments</a>, locations, and systems. By having a standardized set of processes, businesses can reduce errors, improve quality, and reduce the risk of compliance issues.<h3 class='text-dark text-bold'>Improved Customer Experience</h3><p>BPM can also help businesses to improve the customer experience by identifying areas where customer satisfaction can be improved. Businesses can identify bottlenecks, pain points, and areas where customers are dissatisfied by analyzing customer interactions. This helps organizations to develop solutions that address these issues and improve the overall customer experience.<h3 class='text-dark text-bold'>Better Risk Management</h3><p>BPM also helps businesses identify and manage risks by mapping out processes and identifying potential risk areas. By identifying potential risks, organizations can develop strategies to mitigate these risks, reduce the likelihood of issues, and minimize the impact of any issues that do occur.<h3 class='text-dark text-bold'>Enhanced Decision-Making</h3><p>By having a standardized set of processes and access to real-time data, organizations can make more informed decisions. BPM provides organizations with the data and insights they need to make decisions quickly and effectively, which can lead to better business outcomes.<h2 class='text-dark blog-defaulth2'>Top 5 Reasons to Choose a Business Process Management Consultant for Your Organization</h2><h3 class='text-dark text-bold'>Expertise and Experience</h3><p>Business process management consultants have a wealth of experience and expertise in implementing BPM solutions for organizations of all sizes and across different industries. Businesses can tap into this experience and expertise by working with a consultant to develop customized solutions that meet their specific needs.<h3 class='text-dark text-bold'>Customized Solutions</h3><p>BPM consultants work closely with their clients to develop customized solutions that address their organization's specific needs. By understanding each organization's unique requirements and challenges, BPM consultants can develop solutions tailored to their specific needs.<h3 class='text-dark text-bold'>Access to Industry Best Practices</h3><p>BPM consultants deeply understand industry best practices and can bring this knowledge to bear on their client’s projects. This means organizations can benefit from the latest thinking and approaches to BPM and improve their operations accordingly.<h3 class='text-dark text-bold'>Implementation Support</h3><p>Implementing a BPM solution can be a complex and challenging process. BPM consultants can provide the support and guidance organizations need to implement their BPM solutions successfully. This includes providing training, troubleshooting, and ongoing support to ensure that the solution is implemented correctly, and that the organization can benefit from its full potential.<h3 class='text-dark text-bold'>Continuous Improvement and Optimization</h3><p>BPM is not a one-time event. BPM needs to be an ongoing process of continuous improvement and optimization to be truly effective. BPM consultants can help organizations to continuously improve their processes, identify new areas for improvement, and optimize their operations for maximum efficiency.<h3 class='text-dark text-bold'>Comparison with In-House Management</h3><p>While some organizations may attempt to implement a BPM solution in-house, this can be a challenging and time-consuming. By working with a BPM consultant, organizations can benefit from the consultant's experience, expertise, and specialized knowledge. This can help organizations to avoid common pitfalls and ensure that their BPM solution is implemented correctly and effectively.<h2 class='text-dark blog-defaulth2'>Bottom Line</h2><p>BPM is an effective way for organizations to improve their operations, increase efficiency, and provide better customer experiences. Organizations can benefit from the experience, expertise, and specialized knowledge by working with a business process management company to develop customized solutions that meet their needs. With the help of a BPM consultant, organizations can achieve their goals of improved efficiency, streamlined operations, and enhanced customer experiences.

When a person sees his/her expectations getting fulfilled, they tend to feel content.</p><p>It is the same way for your personal and professional life. Expectations can either lead you to feel happy and contented or can lead you in the very opposite direction as well.</p><p>When you work with a person or a business, you have a specific picture of the outcome in your mind. Well, the first step for succeeding with any such association is to lay out your expectation clearly in terms of what you need, when you need it, and how to go about it.</p><p>Many businesses feel that they did not have a great experience while working with an outsourcing service provider. I know your expectations are high as you hire a professional team to deliver to you. There could be many factors for undesired outcomes and your bitter experience, but did you ever analyze it? Could it be a lack of communication in translating your expectations?</p><p>Let us take a few pointers to see how you can build an excellent foundation for your business process outsourcing needs.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>List Down Your Requirements</h2> <p>First things first, you must write down your requirements on paper. So, you exactly know what all things you need to accomplish by hiring a Business Process Outsourcing Company (BPO).</p><p>Define your what, when, and how explicitly. If done correctly, you can count on a great start to your association. The remaining success of the relationship depends on the right BPO partner.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Dive In</h2> <p>Now, let us do some research! Google is your best friend if you know what you are looking for. The list can be endless and sounds like when you are looking out for a life partner. You have many expectations; however, it is crucial to start with the basics first. Your preliminary checklist can look like this:</p><p>My Idle BPO Partner will have-</p><ul class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <li> <p> A wide experience. A company that is well established. </p></li><li> <p> Has an excellent infrastructure to support your work needs. </p></li><li> <p> Offers the services you are looking for (the obvious). </p></li><li> <p> Have a pool of professional staff working with them. </p></li><li> <p> Tenure of their senior team members in the company. </p></li><li> <p> Have robust security features. </p></li><li> <p> Have a professional and internationally recognized compliance certificate like ISO. </p></li><li> <p> Their current clients can vouch for them. </p></li><li> <p> Do they have any ratings on Google Review or a third party like Clutch? </p></li><li> <p> Do they have a contract? If yes, what is the bottleneck? </p></li></ul> <p>If you find a company meeting all these points, congratulations, you hit the Jackpot!</p><p>One can get to know more about a company by learning about the culture, the beliefs of the company’s leaders (what drives them), the employee perspective (how much fun it is to work), what is the mission, vision, and values of the company. All these things will help you build your trust in your BPO partner and, more importantly, filter and narrow down your research.</p><h2 class='text-dark text-bold'>Weigh Up!</h2> <p>Now, the very immediate step is to start weighing up your requirements against the insights you got from the Dive In section. This part is the most critical and important one as this will help you make the decision.</p><p>Start by matching up the services you want versus the services provided by the Business Process Outsourcing company. Look for the hidden benefits you can get once you have opted in for the services, such as a trial, dedicated virtual professional or team, and management bandwidth so that there is no need for you to micro-manage and oversee your virtual staff.</p><p>Once you have matched all your requirements, get in touch with the company. I also suggest speaking to at least one of their existing clients. It will help you establish trust, and more importantly, you can gain some ideas on how to utilize the services effectively.</p><p>You will be surprised to realize how hassle-free your life can be after outsourcing some of the activities off your plate.</p><p>We at FBSPL have been working with businesses since 2006.

The trend of outsourcing tasks saves time and money and despite being a popular choice among business leaders, it has to face some erroneous beliefs. When it comes to choosing global business consulting services, most companies and personnel have all sorts of misapprehensions.</p><p>While the global market’s dimension of outsourced services has reached up to $76.9 billion, misconceptions still prevail. So, to help you separate these fallacies from the facts, here is some reality check that demystifies the 5 major BPO myths.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Misconception #1</h2> <h3 class='text-dark text-bold'>Outsourcing is A Costly Affair</h3> <p>Fact: While a lot of people think that outsourcing is going to cost them a fortune, in reality, <a href='<?=$baseurl2?>'>outsourcing companies</a> can offer a saving of around 20% to 30% on the salary outlays of hiring in-house staff. More often outsourcing companies implement solutions that improve existing business processes while reducing expenses.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Misconception #2</h2> <h3 class='text-dark text-bold'>No Regulation Over Your Project</h3> <p>Fact: When it comes to outsourcing, many business owners believe that they will lose regulation or visibility over their projects.

On the brighter side, there are some tools like process control and analysis tools that enable continuous monitoring. Outsourcing your business work can help you maintain the optimum level of data security in the industry.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Misconception #4</h2> <h3 class='text-dark text-bold'>Outsourcing Companies Just Don’t Get It</h3> <p>Fact: Again, it’s not true that outsourcing firms don’t understand your business. Business process partners have industry experts who comprehend your business and work hard to discover the nitty-gritty of your processes and requirements.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Misconception #5</h2> <h3 class='text-dark text-bold'>It’s Just for The Large Firms and Not for Startups</h3> <p>Fact: No matter its size, most outsourcing companies in the USA come up with practicality for your business needs.

The deadline for every delegated task should be pre-defined. </p></li><li> <p> <b>Questions and Clarifications:</b> Whenever you delegate tasks, be ready to address the concerns, questions, and give the required clarifications. </p></li></ul> <h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Create a List of Priorities</h2> <p>Making a list of priorities doesn’t mean listing 20 to-do things in the directory. If you have 20 items in the list it means you are rushing to complete them all but is not putting efficiency in everything. The right way to prioritize is to put five things on the list and try to achieve them by the end of the day.</p><p>By chance, if you complete them before time, you can add another few things. But it is vital to list out things. You should not juggle with low-value activities and let miscellaneous items creep in.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Make Time Blocks</h2> <p>Yes! You know what all you need to do within a day but every business should have a specific amount of time. It is possible to become productive when you give only a particular time to particular tasks because your mind works under the timeline that the functions need to be completed. And, that is how your brain works in the right direction to finish the task.</p><p>As an example:</p><p>If you have to reply to an email, set only 10 minutes instead of 15 or 20 minutes. Your mind will start functioning faster, and you will try to match with the time limit. Your time limit will set an urgency, push you towards completing the tasks and will stop you from wasting time on social media websites.</p><h2 class='text-dark blog-defaulth2'>Track Time</h2> <p>It is easy to guess how much time you have spent on a job but trying to tell the exact number of minutes. Take the help of any modern or on-the-go time tracking an application as it will help you identify where your time is going.</p><p>It will show up the insights into the way you can improve your productivity. When you start seeing patterns, you will be able to know where the time is leaking. Then you can attack the leak hours and make a plan to utilize it in the best way.</p><p>With time tracking tool, you will get a clear picture of your productive hours and ways to optimize it.</p><h2 class='text-dark blog-defaulth2'>Simplify Life (Know the Time Management Tricks)</h2> <p>We all! Yes, we all have a habit of wasting our efforts in many places. There is a lot of ways you can save time while binge-watching Netflix.</p><p>Trust me and follow these hacks. You will experience a hike in your hours. You will start doing things that matter without feeling tired.</p><ul class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <li> <p> Choose your week’s outfits on Sunday rather than doing it every day. </p></li><li> <p> Subscribe to daily fruits and vegetables so that it can be delivered directly to your home. </p></li><li> <p> Your snack or sports bag can be left in your car. So, even if you are getting late, there is not much loss you are doing to your day. </p></li><li> <p> Buy two chargers of every gadget that you have. One should be part of your room, and another should be a part of your car. </p></li><li> <p> Managing and transferring money can be a pain sometimes. Let your paycheck always go to your savings account, every time. Regulate your money from only one place; it is the way to avoid money hassle. </p></li><li> <p> Attach your Gmail to Dropbox or any cloud storage. Every time you email gets an attachment; it will automatically get saved in an appropriate folder. </p></li></ul> <h2 class='text-dark blog-defaulth2'>Don’t Run after Perfectionism</h2> <p>If you are always trying to do things perfectly, you are not completing jobs on time.</p><p>Sometimes delivering a thing on time is the skill you need. Learn to accept that every time details don’t matter. You can even complete a job with basic requirements, shoot, and fix the flaws later as well.</p><p>A continuous art of learning and improving is better than being in an endless cycle of perfectionism.</p><h2 class='text-dark blog-defaulth2'>One thing at a time</h2> <p>Multitasking is not the right way that you aim.</p><p>Understand that every brain is designed to do one thing at a time. Fast switching between the tasks is very likely to make mistakes. Don’t try to check all the notifications on your phone while doing the job. Close all the extra tabs in your phone and laptop. Give enough time to do the pending task and move to the next, only when you’re done.</p><p>We are always trying to achieve more than we can. A continuous mistake that we do in the process is by trying to do multitasking. Let your brain utilize and invest all the energy only in one direction; the results will be tremendous.</p><h2 class='text-dark blog-defaulth2'>Don’t Miss the Fun</h2> <p>We get caught up in the busyness and forget to enjoy what we’re doing. Let every task that you do involve motivation, concentration, and fun while you are doing it. Involve fun in everything you do, and you won’t have to refer to time management techniques anymore.</p><p>For now, try applying at least 5 of these techniques to your schedule and notice the elevation in your happiness, work satisfaction, and personal growth. It will make you realize how to put the same 24 hours to use but with different style.</p></div></article> </div></div></div></div><div class='col-md-12 text-center'> <h4 class='font-weight-semibold mb-2 pb-1 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible'> Share this Post</h4></div><div class='share-buttons-container'> <div class='share-list'> <a class='fb-h' onclick='return fbs_click()' target='_blank' title='FACEBOOK'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/facebook-f.png'> </a> <a class='tw-h' onclick='return tbs_click()' target='_blank' title='TWITTER'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/twitter-squared.png'> </a> <a class='li-h' onclick='return lbs_click()' target='_blank' title='LINKEDIN'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/linkedin.png'> </a> <a data-pin-do='buttonPin' data-pin-config='none' class='pi-h' onclick='return pbs_click()' target='_blank' title='PINTEREST'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/90/000000/pinterest.png'> </a> </div></div>",

Hiring one for your business ensures productivity and overall efficiency.</p><p>Even after knowing all the benefits of having a virtual assistant, every business owner raises the question, “Are virtual assistants safe?”</p><p>This blog will help you understand the factors that need to be considered before hiring a virtual assistant and provide tips for maintaining security with a VA to create a safe environment for your business operations.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Factors to Consider Before Hiring Virtual Assistant?</h2> <p>We are sharing some factors you should consider before hiring for you. Let’s understand them one by one:</p><h3 class='text-dark text-bold'>Analyze Your Roles and Responsibilities</h3> <p>First, you must write down your responsibilities and roles to understand the tasks you want a virtual assistant to manage.</p><p>This will help you create a list of which tasks you don’t need to spend time on further, and based on the list, it will be easy to choose the VA according to the expertise for the specific tasks.</p><h3 class='text-dark text-bold'>Consider Flexibility and Time-Zone</h3> <p>Virtual assistants work remotely from different geographic locations. It would be ideal to have a mutual understanding of timing and flexibility before hiring a VA.</p><p>One question you should ask the VA before hiring is whether they will be open to working at any time of day. This will help you avoid future work delays due to time differences.</p><h3 class='text-dark text-bold'>Acknowledge the Time-period</h3> <p>Determining whether you are hiring for a short term or a long term will help you decide on various factors.</p><p>Considering the contract period before hiring a VA will help you set your budget accordingly and will help you classify and prioritize the tasks that need to be handled by a skilled candidate.</p><h3 class='text-dark text-bold'>Test Trial for Accuracy</h3> <p>Some virtual assistants are open to providing a post-hiring test trial after the interview to mutually understand the workflows, services, and coordination. It will be worthwhile to consider a test trial before making any contract.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>3 Tips to Maintain Security with VAs</h2> <p>It is clear that when you hire a virtual assistant, you have to give them a lot of credentials and access to ensure efficient work.</p><p>But it’s really hard to trust someone you’ve never met. Building trust for a new person with a completely different geographic location is not part of human nature.</p><p>Here we’re sharing three tips for maintaining high security with the VA and ensuring its benefits to your business. Let’s check them out:</p><h3 class='text-dark text-bold'>Access to the accounts</h3> <p>Providing access to the accounts will make the VA available to conduct operations without sharing the passwords of your personal and business accounts.</p><p>It would be ideal not to give them access to the administration level (e.g., Gmail, Facebook, Mail Chimp, etc.) in the initial stage. Do not provide higher access to the administration until mutual understanding and a relationship are developed.</p><p>You can use LastPass, Dropbox, GoogleSuite, Microsoft Office 365, and more to access accounts, folders, files, documents, and spreadsheets without sharing the passwords and keeping good track of them.</p><h3 class='text-dark text-bold'>Documentation</h3> <p>Documentation is a major part of ensuring safety with the VA. It will be easier to maintain security by getting signed documents with work policies and mutual agreements related to disputes.</p><p>Suppose a VA violates any policy, disputes, or initiates a security breach. In that case, the signed document will help to legally take action against it and receive compensation for the actions.</p><p>You should do signing contracts, non-disclosure agreements, and other necessary documents under the supervision of an attorney to ensure no legal loopholes.</p><h3 class='text-dark text-bold'>Multi-factor Authentication</h3> <p>Adding multi-factor authentication to your accounts will help you prevent unauthorized users from accessing your accounts. You can easily track where the login has been initiated.</p><p>Multi-factor authentication will also protect your account from hackers. If you feel the login was not legitimate, In that case, you can easily block your account before any damage happens to it.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Conclusion: Hire Virtual Assistants from a Reliable Company</h2> <p>We hope you have understood the factors to consider before hiring a virtual assistant and the tips to ensure security while getting associated with them.</p><p>To make the process less complicated and burden-free, you must hire the VA from a reliable company.</p><p><a href='<?=$baseurl2?>'>FBSPL</a> provides outsourced virtual assistant services to provide your organization the ability to scale business with VAs without having to onboard new employees.</p></div></article> </div></div></div></div><div class='col-md-12 text-center'> <h4 class='font-weight-semibold mb-2 pb-1 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible'> Share this Post</h4></div><div class='share-buttons-container'> <div class='share-list'> <a class='fb-h' onclick='return fbs_click()' target='_blank' title='FACEBOOK'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/facebook-f.png'> </a> <a class='tw-h' onclick='return tbs_click()' target='_blank' title='TWITTER'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/twitter-squared.png'> </a> <a class='li-h' onclick='return lbs_click()' target='_blank' title='LINKEDIN'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/linkedin.png'> </a> <a data-pin-do='buttonPin' data-pin-config='none' class='pi-h' onclick='return pbs_click()' target='_blank' title='PINTEREST'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/90/000000/pinterest.png'> </a> </div></div>",

Aside from cutting down business expenses, and their marked proficiency (with one BT survey indicating remote workers were on the average 20% more proficient at handling tasks than traditional office workers) offshore teams are also famous for the much-needed spice and diversity they inject into a company’s workstream. These characteristics make them a truly invaluable asset, but the caveat, however, is that for these benefits to manifest to the good of a company, remote offshore teams must be properly managed. How do you go about achieving this, it’s simple;</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>First things First, Hire the Right Employees</h2> <p>An offshore employee (like every other employee) cannot perform above his/her capabilities. Just as you took great care and effort to recruit your in-house team, same procedures should be undertaken in the selection process for an offshore team. Pay keen attention to the littlest of details, and be on the lookout for personality traits that make remote governance a breeze. Examples of such traits include effective communication and time management skills, diligent work ethics and the ability to work in a team. Granted such traits are hard to pick out on the first impression, but a laser-eyed inquisition into their past employment histories should provide valuable insight.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Lay Down a Practical Framework for Communication</h2> <p>Effective communication is key to the survivability and profitability of just about any relationship – workplace relationships included. If your offsite team is to work in tandem and sync with your in-house team, then there must be an uninterrupted line of communication between the two factions. Round the clock communication is essential for keeping both parties in the know, and for making sure you’re on top of your oversight functions. As a rule of thumb, make provisions for alternate communication routes, for times of urgency (and emergency). You could do this by having a dedicated phone line, email server or fax machine linked to the offsite team.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Be Clear About your Expectations</h2> <p>While effective communication does pave the way for sufficient interaction, there’s no doubt that interaction is limited with regards to offsite teams (at least when compared to units located onsite). Consequently, it is crucial that you provide a detailed rubric that outlines the expected aims, ambitions and goals of a specified task since you’re physically incapable of guiding them through the process to completion. Another thing that’s worth clarifying is the expected turnover date, as there’s always a proclivity for procrastination when it comes to offsite completion of tasks.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Promote Offsite – Onsite and General Employee Synergy</h2> <p>A team can only function as a team if there’s cohesion among its constituent members, anything otherwise and you’ve got yourself a bunch of individual talents mixed up in a cesspool of unproductive competition. It is therefore imperative that you create sustainable channels that foster interpersonal relationships; first between constituent members of both onsite and offsite teams and then between the onsite and offsite teams as a whole. Productivity is increased if both factions see themselves as pieces of the jigsaw puzzle that interlock to create the big picture rather than viewing themselves as opposing ends of the same coin. An excellent way to go about building interpersonal relationships is to organize employee get-togethers; If you have a Slack, Discord, or any other team viewer app, creating off-topic lounges where employees can interact freely also works pretty well.</p><p>Finally, everyone loves a transparent manager – being honest and straightforward with your opinions, suggestions, and directives is a fertile breeding ground for the seed of trust. And no manager commands more followership than the manager who is trusted by his employees.</p><p><a href='<?=$baseurl2?>/book-free-consultation-call'>Book a free consultation call with the experts today!</a></p></div></article> </div></div></div></div><div class='col-md-12 text-center'> <h4 class='font-weight-semibold mb-2 pb-1 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible'> Share this Post</h4></div><div class='share-buttons-container'> <div class='share-list'> <a class='fb-h' onclick='return fbs_click()' target='_blank' title='FACEBOOK'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/facebook-f.png'> </a> <a class='tw-h' onclick='return tbs_click()' target='_blank' title='TWITTER'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/twitter-squared.png'> </a> <a class='li-h' onclick='return lbs_click()' target='_blank' title='LINKEDIN'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/linkedin.png'> </a> <a data-pin-do='buttonPin' data-pin-config='none' class='pi-h' onclick='return pbs_click()' target='_blank' title='PINTEREST'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/90/000000/pinterest.png'> </a> </div></div>",

If you don’t know “How can a virtual assistant help your business?” reading this blog will help you comprehend the responsibilities of a virtual assistant and the advantages of having a virtual assistant in your company.</p><h3 class=' text-dark'>Top Eleven Advantages of Having A Virtual Assistant In Your Team</h3> <ul class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <p>If you are planning to hire a virtual assistant for your business but are not sure what are the benefits they bring with them or are confused about how to use a virtual assistant, then here are the top 11 virtual assistant advantages for your business:</p><li><p><b>Time-Saving</b> It is one of the main benefits of hiring a virtual assistant. From the daily grind of processing invoices to making financial statements like revenue, cost, or expenses, tasks like this can be a real-time killer.</p><p>By delegating time-consuming tasks to VA, you can focus on the more important tasks and core responsibilities of business operations.</p></li><li><p><b>Productivity</b> One of the advantages of hiring a virtual assistant is that it increases a company’s overall productivity. A VA manages daily critical tasks such as managing email, maintaining spreadsheets, data entry, communication over phone calls, contacting vendors and customers, preparing invoices and financial statements, and more.</p></li><li><p><b>Increased Flexibility</b> Since VA support doesn’t follow a standard 9 to 5 schedule, creating a flexible timetable is easy. When your personnel is distributed across time zones, assigning tasks based on specific demands is effortless. You’ll have more time to attend meetings, bring in new customers, or develop new products and content for your company.</p></li><li><p><b>Business Growth</b> A VA helps your business expand with the advantage of flexible hours, affordable perks, and an emphasis on administrative duties. You’ll not only save money on overhead expenses, but you’ll also have more time and flexibility to concentrate on your company’s long-term objectives. You’ll get more time to focus on business growth if you outsource duties.</p></li><li><p><b>Greater Work Efficiency</b> VA provides efficient work because they’re self-employed. As they receive their salary on the work performed on an hourly basis, they tend to be inclined to focus on earning the most money feasible. They are more dedicated to customer satisfaction because they want repeat business and great feedback. A virtual assistant can aid in the stabilization and optimization of major work operations duties, including: <li>Market monitorings</li><li>Competitors tracking</li><li>Social media review analysis</li></p></li><li><p><b>Cost Savings</b> One of the primary benefits of hiring a virtual assistant is that it will save your company money while enhancing performance. Because they normally charge on an hourly or task basis, you only have to pay them for their job. You don’t need to locate an extra room or buy specific equipment to set up a workstation for a VA.</p></li><li><p><b>Timely Client Support Service</b> Delayed customer support services affect brand loyalty and satisfaction. Delegating some of your tasks to a VA will help you improve customer communication. A VA helps in many customer support tasks, including: <li>Replying to inquiries and queries</li><li>Creating customer lists from email or FAQ replies</li><li>Keeping track of your consumer base</li><li>Reviewing social media channels analysis</li></p></li><li><p><b>Eradicating Stress</b> Sound mental health promotes efficient company operations, which lowers the everyday stress of work and other activities. Having a reliable VA to whom you can delegate some of your team’s tasks will allow you to be more productive while reducing your workload. As a result, you will have a more relaxed working atmosphere.</p></li><li><p><b>Eradicating Stress</b> Sound mental health promotes efficient company operations, which lowers the everyday stress of work and other activities.

A skilled VA will provide you with various accounting tasks, including: <li>Budgeting</li><li>Inventory Management</li><li>Cash Flow Projection</li><li>Year-End Accounting</li><li>Year-End Accounting</li><li>Implementing record keeping and accounting procedures</li><li>Overhaul existing accounting systems</li></p></li><li><p><b>Sales Outreach</b> Sales are essential to a company’s survival, yet outreach and activity tracking require significant inputs.

This factor rate multiplies the total amount and determines the amount to be repaid.</p><p>For example, if you had an advance from a lender of $5,000 with a factor rate of 1.5%, you would owe the grantor $7,500.</p></ul> <ul class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <li><b>Holdback</b></li><p>Holdback percentage contracts are based on a daily collection process. A fixed percentage of the amount is automatically transferred to the lender’s account until the total amount of the advance plus additional interest is paid.</p><p>Repayment terms in MCAs generally range from three months to one year. Still, some grantors may offer more extended periods depending on the factors of the contract parameters.</p></ul> <h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Pros Of an MCA</h2> <p>Nothing is more evaluative to a business than the money needed to improve and upgrade operations within an estimated time. The company that needs a lump sum amount in a short period will understand the importance of merchant cash advances.</p><p>Let’s check out some of the pros of MCA to see why merchant cash advances are significant to an organization:</p><ul class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <li><b>Fast Funding</b></li><p>The most significant advantage of MCA is that you get the funds very quickly required for the urgent business operational demands. You don’t have to provide a lot of documentation and do not have to fill out many forms, which ultimately saves a lot of time.</p></ul> <ul class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <li><b>No Collaterals</b></li><p>Collateral is usually property, registries, policies, bonds, and other documents you provide to the grantor or bank in exchange for the loan.</p><p>The collateral assures the loan providers that the amount will be returned with interest within the stipulated time; otherwise, the grantor has the option to recover his loss from the collateral.</p><p>But in MCA, you do not need to provide any collateral to back up the loan, which makes MCA the right choice to opt for.</p></ul> <ul class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <li><b>Payment Adjusting</b></li><p>The loan installment mostly depends on the sales percentage in MCA, so if the sales of your business fall, then the payment will also not remain constant.</p><p>The flexible payment option makes it more <a href='<?=$baseurl2?>/blog/5-benefits-of-outsourcing-your-accounting-finance'>beneficial for the business.</a> You can also accommodate holdback transactions if the company is going through a slow sales phase.</p></ul> <ul class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <li><b>Eligibility Requirements</b></li><p>The traditional loans provided by the banks have credit score criteria, which sometimes makes it difficult for businesses to qualify for the loan due to low credit scores.</p><p>MCA is beneficial for a business that needs immediate working capital without meeting the eligibility requirements for a traditional loan.</p></ul> <h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Is Merchant Cash Advance Suitable for Your Business?</h2> <p>Have you heard the famous saying “with the good comes the bad”? You have to be cautious while applying for MCA because if the criteria are not understood clearly, it can also lead to a loss in the business profit.</p><p>You should be clear about the factoring percentage before signing the deal. It can harm you with the added cost of paying in the long run; instead, you have taken it for a short period.</p><p>You must understand all the norms before availing yourself of the cash advance. Suppose the norms are preferable and MCA is suitable to meet your business demands. In that case, MCA will be an additional opportunity for your business to take advantage of.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Conclusion:</h2> <p><b>Decided to Go With MCA? You Must Get Professional Supervision!</b></p><p>It is important to have a team of professionals before incorporating Merchant Cash Advance. They will provide merchant cash advance solutions and guide what would be the right deal for the business.</p><p>MCA may seem like a quick process, but tasks like reverse consolidation, payment processing, and other mundane activities take futile time and need expertise.</p><p>It is ideal to outsource all related activities and understandings to a <a href='<?=$baseurl2?>/book-free-consultation-call'>well-versed MCA professional team,</a> permitting you to focus on the core functions and maximize the benefits of merchant cash advance strategy for your business.</p></div></article> </div></div></div></div><div class='col-md-12 text-center'> <h4 class='font-weight-semibold mb-2 pb-1 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible'> Share this Post</h4></div><div class='share-buttons-container'> <div class='share-list'> <a class='fb-h' onclick='return fbs_click()' target='_blank' title='FACEBOOK'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/facebook-f.png'> </a> <a class='tw-h' onclick='return tbs_click()' target='_blank' title='TWITTER'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/twitter-squared.png'> </a> <a class='li-h' onclick='return lbs_click()' target='_blank' title='LINKEDIN'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/linkedin.png'> </a> <a data-pin-do='buttonPin' data-pin-config='none' class='pi-h' onclick='return pbs_click()' target='_blank' title='PINTEREST'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/90/000000/pinterest.png'> </a> </div></div>",

While remote work has many advantages for businesses, it also poses unique security risks that aren’t present in regular office settings.</p><p>This article highlights those obstacles, discusses how they alter the nature of cybersecurity needs and provides recommendations for securing remote access.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Why is there a need to secure remote access?</h2> <p>When employees work remotely, the nature and extent of cybersecurity threats shift. Workers’ reliance on personal computers, routers, and other devices that could be infected with malware emerges as new forms of threats that are difficult for corporate IT employees to monitor and safeguard.</p><p>An employee’s requirement to access or send data across public internet connections when connecting to systems or storage resources in their company’s offices is a novel threat in this scenario. Third parties could eavesdrop on the links and steal valuable information if that data is not adequately secured, which would be more challenging to achieve if all data remained inside corporate networks.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>How to be safe while you’re working from home?</h2> <p>Certain cybersecurity dangers, such as phishing, have become more frequent due to the surge in remote working. One significant difficulty is that an IT staff will oversee cybersecurity in most offices. Employees must be more mindful of cybersecurity threats as part of a distributed workforce working from home. Here is one of the best remote-working security recommendations to keep you and your employees safe while working from home.</p><ol class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <li><p><b>Security Training</b> : Organizations’ standard security safeguards for on-site staff are sometimes insufficient and impracticable for remote workers. Employees must be well-trained to understand the increased hazards they will encounter while working remotely, as well as the obligations they will be responsible for. The best method to ensure that each employee understands and accepts the dangers of working from home is to include cybersecurity training when onboarding new workers and to train existing employees with security refresher training.</p></li><li><p><b>Regular Audits</b> : Internal audits and third-party penetration testing are required frequently. Auditing should be regularly as feasible as technology advances, and new software and techniques are developed. IT professional audits are critical for identifying gaps in current security standards and for discovering misconfiguration and poor security practices that could lead to more serious concerns down the road.</p></li><li><p><b>Email Encryption</b> : Since the pandemic outbreak, the number of spam and phishing emails received has skyrocketed. Employers must not be complacent, even though most people are aware of them and know not to be deceived by these emails. Spam and phishing emails often contain a malicious virus, leading to an unknown employee providing criminals with critical information. Encrypting all emails ensures that the content is hidden, protecting any sensitive information exchanged during an email conversation and allowing only the intended recipient to see it.</p></li><li><p><b>Develop and Implement Clear Security Policies</b> : Before the coronavirus outbreak, businesses were battling security issues arising from remote workers and the expanding use of personal devices.</p><p>Consider the following scenario:</p><ul> <li>Personal devices may be allowed in specific instances if employees follow other security regulations. For example, you might require employees to install approved security software and only permit them to connect to your network using your business VPN.</li><li>In other circumstances, you may instruct employees in sensitive areas to use just the laptops or other devices you have provided them with and use them only in ways you have permitted. You may, for example, limit the usage of these company-issued devices to work and prohibit employees from watching films or browsing social media sites on them.</li></ul> <p>In any situation, developing clear policies is critical.

Have you engaged a virtual assistant to work on your project? Do any of your staff wish to work remotely? If you replied “yes” to any of these questions, you have a good understanding of how it feels to manage remote workers. And you’re probably aware of the significance of encouraging remote workers. You must continue to motivate remote workers, whether they are at home or on the other side of the world, for them to be as productive as possible. Even your most self-sufficient remote workers can benefit from a little extra guidance from you to stay on course.</p><p>Working with virtual assistants can be either a blessing or a curse. Let’s hope that in this situation, you did get an excellent VA and the next step is to keep them ‘turned on’ and interested.</p><p>Engaged VAs are more eager to contribute to your company’s success. They aren’t simply there to take orders in order to make money. They consider their work to be an important contribution to your business.</p><p>Because you’re just communicating with your VA online, it’s easy to lose interest in them.</p><p>However, here are some of the few points you can about. We’ll show you how to keep your virtual assistant engaged and motivated at work.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Create effective communication systems</h2> <p>One of the most prevalent issues that virtual teams experience is miscommunication. After all, exchanging information is easier when you can just walk a few steps over to your colleague’s desk and explain what you want or need.However, with remote teams, a variety of issues might arise, including sickness, home emergencies, internet connection issues, malfunctioning computers, and power outages. Work disruptions are understandable, but the issue arises when VAs fail to communicate what’s going on.</p><p>To avoid this issue, we strongly advise you to set up at least three channels of contact with your virtual team:</p><ul> <li>Daily Check-in or Check-out</li><li>Methods of communication in an emergency</li><li>Weekly or Bi-weekly huddles</li></ul> <p>A remote organization’s lifeblood is communication. A company that does not have a secure link between its virtual assistants and freelancers will eventually fail.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Team meetings or team building activities should be held on a monthly basis</h2> <p>It’s just as important to have a great relationship with your team as it is to have a strong relationship with the rest of your numerical business KPIs. Create a space where you can give and receive feedback, collaborate as a team, and your virtual assistants can freely express themselves and share ideas.Holding team activities in a remote environment might be difficult. These are now more freely accessible thanks to communication services like Zoom and Slack. Plan activities and games to keep your VAs engaged or meet with them periodically to check in and have a casual talk.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Reward your virtual assistants proactively</h2> <p>Compensation, in addition to growth and advancement, is one strategy to inspire and retain your virtual assistants. Giving people the results of their labour is gratifying, and it makes them feel like their contributions are critical to the organization’s success.Our responsibilities as entrepreneurs extend beyond making a profit for our company. We need to encourage internal growth and give back to the people who have contributed to our success. To express our thanks for their commitment to the company, we must keep them engaged through proper compensation.It’s also critical to pay your staff on time and provide them with perks. To avoid excessive staff turnover, don’t make the mistake of underpaying your virtual assistants. Reasonable salary and a positive business culture will keep them interested and motivated to work with you.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Provide Feedback</h2> <p>Not only good feedback, but an appropriate amount of constructive criticism at the end of each assignment can be useful to the company. It takes very little effort to provide actual feedback to your virtual assistants, which can be used and applied in the future to ensure that they continue to perform great and error-free work.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Let your VA know you trust them</h2> <p>One of the most crucial foundations of motivation is trust. When people like and trust their leaders, they are frequently more motivated and willing to generate better results. You can’t expect people to be committed to their work if they don’t trust you or the organization. Regular meetings are the best method to create trust within a remote team. Use virtual meetings to do this at least once a week or at the start of a work or project.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Conclusion:</h2> <p>It’s amazing to collaborate with virtual assistants from all around the world. You will be in charge of virtual assistants from various cultures and backgrounds who will support you in improving yourself and your company. As a result, it is only fair to repay them with equal work and leadership in order to contribute to their development.</p><p>Make a conscious effort to improve your relationship with your virtual assistants by honestly appreciating them.</p><p>We hope you found these suggestions useful.

Attrition management is the process where employer practices to retain its employees by deploying various methods and technologies. Ever given a thought to why? Well, while googling about it, we have accumulated all the questions in three primary buckets.</p><ul> <li>What is Attrition Management?</li><li>Why is Attrition Management so important?</li><li>How can we successfully control Attrition?</li></ul> <p>So, here is our take on the above questions.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>What is Attrition Management?</h2> <p>Attrition refers to the downsizing of a company’s workforce who are unwilling to stay with the company. This means that attrition reduces the workforce size. Attrition happens for several causes, including low salaries, a lack of career progression, poor working conditions, Illness and death, Retirement.</p><p>According to the sources, below is the percentage rate of the reason for Attrition:</p><ul> <li>68% of employees leave due to Controllable factors.</li><li>72% of employees claim they were unhappy with the quality of retention effort.</li><li>37% of employees leave because of their immediate manager.</li><li>3 out of 10 candidates do not join the company despite accepting the offer.</li><li>61% of managers stated they need coaching on areas of appraisal, promotion, and salary-related communication.</li></ul> <p>Attrition is regarded as a health check for any business. Something is wrong if many people are leaving.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Why is Attrition Management so important?</h2> <p>Well, no company wants their highly trained and efficient employees to leave. Leaving employees not only impacts the company but the clients too.</p><p>Let us take the example of John, an employee of ABC Corp, associated with the company for the last five years, awarded as Employee of the Month many times and highly skilled, talented, and deserving employee. Moreover, he is the best on numerous software and technology platforms. He is also serving a crucial client since his joining now, and suddenly, he resigns from the company due to a lack of opportunities.</p><p>Here, John is one of the company’s best employees. He is highly trained and educated and is managing the client exceptionally. Now with his resignation, what will be the losses to the company</p><ul> <li>The company invested in a training program for him. This will all go in vain.</li><li>Knowledge transfer of the current client may not be absolute.</li><li>It will set a precedence for others.</li><li>Training a new employee may unsettle the client.</li><li>Recruitment costs are always involved when you are looking for replacement.</li></ul> <p>To tackle these situations, Attrition Management is essential. To ensure and retain the company’s best employees to have a minimum resignations rate.</p><p>Now, let’s talk next step how we can successfully control Attrition?</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>How can we control Attrition?</h2> <ul class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <li> <b>Hire the best people for the right job</b> <p>The HR department needs to evaluate job descriptions minutely and find candidates who are a best fit as per job requirement and cultural fit. ensuring they have the appropriate skills and personality to keep up with the job and organisation.</p></li><li> <b>Show them opportunities</b> <p>If employees feel they do not see a future within the company, they will look for better opportunities elsewhere.</p></li><li> <b>Provide them with benefits</b> <p> Firms that give the most benefits to their employees are more likely to hold them. Some of these can be performance bonuses, paternity/maternity leave and flexible working hours. Health benefits are most essential, followed by retirement funds. The current pandemic situation has also provided employees with an opportunity to work from home, and that can undoubtedly be added as a benefit for the employees.</p></li><li> <b>Lead with trust</b> <p>If employees trust that a firm is moving in the correct direction, they are less likely to move out. Open communication is crucial to build that trust and will cultivate a sense of ownership throughout a company.</p></li><li> <b>Creating the best work environment</b> <p>Any work environment that makes people feel involved and honours diversity will encourage employees to stay longer.</p></li><li> <b>Prioritize work-life balance and make them feel valued</b> <p>It would be best if you accepted that your employees have a life outside of work. Working remotely and Flexible schedules are the ways.

In the word of customer contact, a channel could be anything – an email, a phone call, social media, live chat, video calling etc.</p><p>An omnichannel approach is about integrating these channels with each other to provide customers with a seamless support experience. Wherein, every channel combines and relates with each other so that the customer can easily switch between them.</p><p>In a more straightforward way, the customer is offered with all or multiple options to connect with the company.</p><p>Let us understand the goals and needs of omnichannel customer support:</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Goals of Omnichannel support:</h2> <ul> <li>Being a customer-centric platform, the main goal of omnichannel support is to provide a consistent customer experience.</li><li>The goal is to engage existing customers of the company and ensure that they get a seamless, consistent, and improved customer experience regardless of support channel being used.</li></ul> <h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Need of Omnichannel support:</h2> <ul> <li>Statistics show that 65% customers contacted customer service at least once in the last month, and 48% have used about 3 to 5 different channels.</li><li>Forcing a customer to stick to a single or few channels have had a negative impact on their overall experience.</li><li>Customers feel annoyed when they are required to repeat their query every time when they switch channels.</li><li>54% of customers today have a higher expectation from customer service as compared to the previous year.</li><li>90% of people say that they will use self–support services if it was available.</li><li>A business that adopts omnichannel support achieves a more significant customer retention rate year over year as compared to companies that do not.</li><li>Customers will even pay 65% more to do business with a company that uses omnichannel support in customer service.</li></ul> <h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Benefits of Omnichannel customer service!</h2> <ul class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <li> <b>More Power to the Customer</b> <p>Omnichannel service helps in expanding the scope of customer service and engagement. It allows a smooth transition of communication between the channels by data integration. Customers today do not like to wait and prefer to connect with a company via any channel of their preference and at any time.By giving such preference to the customers, omnichannel support augments their experience. Furthermore, customers will feel that their choices matter to the company and are more likely to continue using the services for a longer time.</p></li><li> <b>Greater Customer Insights</b> <p>Channels such as social media, chat, forums, webinars etc., leave a written trace of customer interaction. When companies organize these streams of data in a broader context, they can easily understand how their customer needs vary from channel to channel, allowing them to manage their operations accordingly.</p></li><li> <b>Increased Customer Satisfaction</b> <p>75% of customers say that repeating their query repeatedly while communicating through different channels is the most annoying part of their customer service experience. And 45% say that they will abandon a brand if the support staff is not knowledgeable.Things are different with the omnichannel approach. When a customer sends an email, it routes to an agent’s queue. This way, the right agent can respond to the customer’s query, and if the agent is not able to find the solution to the problem by email, the same agent can transfer the interaction to a phone call with just a click and can handle the inquiry from there.Not only this, but the omnichannel tools will display the customer’s history on the agent’s screen. This way, the agent has all the information about the customer and can diagnose their problem whilst switching between different channels, without interrupting the conversation. This kind of customer service builds loyalty and increases customer satisfaction.</p></li><li> <b>Beating The Competition</b> <p>Research from various companies indicates that the companies that employ omnichannel engagement strategies see 12% growth year after year, plus, they also see an increase in the number of customers associated with their brand.Omnichannel customer service is the future and being the first to offer this experience is a way to retain customers.</p></li><li> <b>A Potential Business Growth</b> <p>Customers are likely to promote a service to their friends and families with which they have had a wonderful experience. An excellent omnichannel support experience can lead to word-of-mouth marketing and turn your customers into your promoters.A study suggests that a customer who is satisfied with the support experience will recommend the business to other people nine times.An increase in customer engagement will increase customer satisfaction. This will increase the customer retention rate and lead to higher revenues.</p></li><li> <b>Added Value</b> <p>Omnichannel service is time and cost-efficient as compared to allocating greater workforce to the traditional channels. An Omnichannel strategy transforms the burden from an agent to a technological system. Being able to respond through time-efficient channels free up the agent’s time to undergo training and handle more complex issues. This is the added value to the organization..</p></li></ul> <p><b>When a customer has an inquiry or registers a complaint, they expect:</b></p><ul> <li>Simple options to contact the support agent.</li><li>Quick response from your team.</li><li>A secure and effortless way to fix the issue on their own.</li><li>A level of understanding and empathy.</li><li>Quick resolution to their problems.</li></ul> <p><a href='<?=$baseurl2?>'>FBSPL (Fusion Business Solutions (P) Ltd)</a> provides omnichannel support services to the customers and works on the ideal “keeping U first” approach, where U stands for the customer.

Let’s begin with the risks and challenges'> </a> </div><div class='post-content ms-0 blog-default'> <p>It’s the second consecutive year where COVID-19 continues to have an impact on the businesses around the globe. World economies have never faced such uncertainty before and traditional supply chain mechanisms have been completely impeded.</p><p>Historically, supply chains were viewed to be cost centric. They were designed to draw out the progression of raw materials to final product in a systematic manner and mitigate risks and reduce costs in the process. However, the rise of Covid-19 cannot be categorized as a typical risk event.</p><p>The scale and speed of this calamity has been gigantic to knock companies off-balance. Responding to this pandemic requires end-to-end assessment, optimization and monitoring by the companies. The impact is not only limited to the human health but also to global supply chains, consumer markets and behaviors.</p><p>Through this blog, I aim to highlight the challenges in the global supply chain faced by companies and a prospective response mechanism towards it.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Let’s begin with the risks and challenges:</h2> <ul class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <li> <b>Lack of visibility in the supply chain</b> <p>For decades, the excellence in supply chain operations used to be about moving products and tracking the financial transactions but in a digital era, information is the value. During pandemic, it was realized that majority of the companies (69%) do not have complete visibility to their supply chains. Many of them tend to rely on numerous excel spreadsheets, phone calls or emails from their different trading partners on different data systems. The entire approach is labor intensive and requires active interpersonal coordination and communication. The work from home (WFH) model in the face of multi-country disruptions fractured this process to its core. Lack of communication and absence of unified digital platforms for database management created havoc in the transparency of supply chains.</p></li><li> <b>What can be done?</b> <p>Well, the answer lies in mobilizing the management of entire supply chain. The need of an hour is an intelligent supply chain. Instead of working with a traditional model, complete reinvention of the process is suggested.</p><p>Let’s start from creating an integrated logistics control tower to get real-time visibility into the continuous supply chain. In simpler words, work on a collaborative platform minimizing many email threads, PDFs and hundreds of spreadsheets.</p><p>Now, if I say that companies can reinvent supply chains while being cost-centric, how does that sound? The answer is simple: companies can look for outsourcing agencies. In this decade, the outsourcing industry has become more technology driven, leveraging on applied analytics and providing end-to-end data secured systems with a responsive risk mitigated operations.</p><p>They, not only provide a <b>dedicated staff</b> but also optimize data to improve visibility across demand, inventory, capacity and supply in all ecosystems. A revolutionized supply chain will result in lower operational costs, more sales and improved forecasting. Outsourcing companies invest heavily in the IT and data security of their clients; nevertheless, it is always recommended to check their websites and ensure all security measure certifications are in place.</p><p>You can begin by smaller tasks- choose from wide range of their service desk such as <b>data management, inventory management</b> or material ordering and listings. Secondly, begin by opting for small activities by the outsourcing partner. This will help in identifying the profitability of your partnership. Start with small before going into deep waters.</p></li><li> <b>Talent gaps across omnichannel platforms for customer support</b> <p>Along with disruptions in travel and logistics supply during 2020, significant gap in communication with customers across all platforms was highlighted. In majority of the cases, either the point of contact (POC) showed incompetence in accessing existing networks or the entire ecosystems collapsed due to shutting down of warehouses and passages. In either case, the company suffered from both ends, failure to preserve the continuity in supply chains and greater disaster in effective communication to its customers, producers and other stakeholders.</p><p>Non-visibility in the supply chain was the preliminary cause, additional would be the lack of an exclusive team to handle customer communications and omni-channel support, especially for small and medium-sized businesses.</p></li><li> <b>What can be done?</b> <p>Along with an intelligent supply chain, companies need to build an exclusive wing whose sole purpose is to orchestrate responses to the customers over multiple platforms. They also must be capable in providing actionable insights from analyzing their supply chains to prevent future losses. They need to function in multi-dimensional platforms handling all sorts of customer inquiries such as order tracking, smooth deliveries and returns whilst managing availability across all connected platforms for inventory management, applications and processes. Lastly, the skillsets for such roles must be distinct and eminent.</p><p>Not all companies can afford each listed quality in-house, but smart businesses know to leverage- ‘outsourcing’. BPOs are the virtual experts in providing omni channel support to customers 24/7 round the clock with a highly skilled and dedicated team. Their years of experience in managing customer tickets, phone, chat and email support by utilizing the latest technology and tools make them highly competent. Not only adapting the customer centric approach but also systemized and data-driven forecasting will ensure a streamlined supply chain for greater profitability.</p></li></ul> <p><b>Let’s begin by exploring some of these services today <a href='<?=$baseurl2?>/bpm-outsourcing-services'>FBSPL</a></b></p></div></article> </div></div></div></div><div class='col-md-12 text-center'> <h4 class='font-weight-semibold mb-2 pb-1 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible'> Share this Post</h4></div><div class='share-buttons-container'> <div class='share-list'> <a class='fb-h' onclick='return fbs_click()' target='_blank' title='FACEBOOK'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/facebook-f.png'> </a> <a class='tw-h' onclick='return tbs_click()' target='_blank' title='TWITTER'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/twitter-squared.png'> </a> <a class='li-h' onclick='return lbs_click()' target='_blank' title='LINKEDIN'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/linkedin.png'> </a> <a data-pin-do='buttonPin' data-pin-config='none' class='pi-h' onclick='return pbs_click()' target='_blank' title='PINTEREST'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/90/000000/pinterest.png'> </a> </div></div>",

I mean, you can find almost everything on Amazon, isn’t it? How do they do that?</p><p>Amazon does this through its marketplace. It has been reported that more than 300,000 US-based small and medium-sized retailers sell through the marketplace. It is the platform by which third-party sellers’ partner with Amazon to market and sell their products.</p><p>They leverage the product deliverability, supply chain and brand image of the e-commerce giant. Alternatively, Amazon has successfully provided a vast range of products and ensured customer satisfaction.</p><p>According to an article in Forbes, Jeff Bezos reportedly mentioned that third-party marketplace sellers contribute to more than half of all products being sold on their platforms worldwide.</p><p>Registering as a seller on Amazon is straightforward, but for several categories that requires additional product certifications and quality-controls, the task can be long and tedious. While the small and medium-sized businesses that largely make up the marketplace have been great for Amazon, there is no surety whether Amazon has been equally great for them.</p><p>The company has undoubtedly siphoned sales from retailers of all sorts and on the other hand, it has given many entrepreneurs the chance to reach a larger audience than they ever could have otherwise.</p><p>It is becoming increasingly challenging to be ‘found on Amazon’, as the platform is overflowing with a variety of products from marketers all over the world. Businesses are in a constant battle against counterfeits, illegal listing, unethical business practices and lower prices.</p><p>This is the reason you will find a numerous new sellers and manufacturers are building their own online shops. Using technology on the likes of Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce, these businesses are adopting Direct to Customer model or more popularly knows as D2C. It has its own benefits, and you reap the rewards without giving a cut to any marketplace.</p><p>However, the size of audience and reach available with Amazon is no joke and one must seriously consider what model works well for them.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Let us look at some basic requirements for being an Amazon Seller:</h2> <ul class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <li> <b>Amazon seller central account</b> <p>It’s the seller’s primary business account. Sellers manage their products, listings, order processing, inventory stock and returns per Amazon standards.</p></li><li> <b>Product listing</b> <p> An Amazon product listing is the product page for each item you sell. It comprises information about the product such as its title, description, images and price. The right product description will enhance your chance of success as a seller on Amazon. However, if done incorrectly, it can lead to lesser sales, bad reviews and customer dissatisfaction. Another problem is the constant counterfeiting of your listings. As a business, you need to divert a lot of time on the website to avoid counterfeiting and ensure a unique listing.</p></li><li> <b>Brand creation</b> <p>Despite having multiple ranges of products, one often prefers to buy from a known brand even at a slightly higher price. New sellers have to create brand awareness by providing quality products, affordable prices and efficient marketing. All this requires dedicated employees working on the platform.</p></li><li> <b>Customer Service</b> <p>Be it retail or online stores, customers look for exceptional service and great products. They expect faster responses, continuous customer assistance and easy returns. Your customer wants 24/7 connectivity over texts, emails, calls and in the inquiry section.</p></li><li> <b>Reputation Management</b> <p>They say it is not the product that sell, it is the sum of a product’s reviews that sell. As a business you must be on your toes to manage the reviews by stellar services and products. It includes not just the quality of a product but the total package, including the packaging, shipping time, delivery aspects, customer support and in some cases post sales services as well.</p></li></ul> <p>But all the hard work if planned well, pays off. You cannot deny Amazon is undisputed giant in the ecommerce arena and it has made life beautiful for a lot of sellers. Again, all it takes is a well-defined strategy, a fantastic product range and immaculate customer services providing the best-in-class customer experience.</p><p>If you have made it thus far in this article, it is safe to assume that either you have just become an Amazon seller or planning to be one. If that is the case, keep an eye on our next publication that deals with how, Amazon sellers can utilize a virtual assistant to ease their workflow.</p><p>And if the wait seems to much, we are just a <a href='<?=$baseurl2?>/book-free-consultation-call'>click away</a>.

The economies are hit badly, but a few lucky businesses have liberty to work online, and their staff are provisioned to work from home. However, not everyone can work remotely or in WFH (work from home) setup efficiently. To top it up there is the fear of uncertainty that looms over our heads and is draining us inside out.</p><p>The need of the hour is to move away from all the negativity, plan our days, work life balance, and keep a tally of our physical health. There is no need to lose your cool during these trying times. The government of all countries, WHO, the team of scientists and doctors, Non-Profits, and a lot many good Samaritans are fighting for us and are making a roadmap for overcoming this heinous virus’ doing all over the world.</p><p>Not everything is in our control, we must have faith and hope for such matters. However, today let us focus on what is in our control and discuss how we can improve our experience during this work from home era:</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Do something that makes you happy and keeps you healthy.</h2> <ul> <li>This one sound obvious, but is it? Avoid going to the market or anywhere outside for that matter. No grocery or vegetable is more important than you. Get your supplies online.</li><li>Limit social media, Television, and overall screen time. Most importantly stay away from those news channels, which are sharing everything but news.</li><li>Take time out for the family, friends, and your office colleagues. Healthy relationships and friends are the most effective boosters for a good mental health.</li><li>With the access to the world of the Internet, you can spend time to sharpen your skills or learning new skills. New skills will boost self confidence and self-esteem both at work and personal life.</li><li>In your free time, spend time with the children as well as play with them, which will give you self-satisfaction. Indoor games and yoga exercises with children can be catalytic to your mental and physical health.</li></ul> <h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>How to focus on work during pandemic</h2> <ul> <li>First things first, if your home space allows, have a separate and distinct place for your work. It helps you to get in work mode and keeps you away from distractions.</li><li>Set up a fixed time for your work schedule and personal chores. Best way is to keep the same working hours as you would follow during the work at office.</li><li>Plan your day, it is more important now when you are working from home. Keep your to dos at check and set priorities. Same should be done for personal chores so that you do not find yourself dangling between both.</li><li>Make use of technology to stay in touch with your clients and colleagues. Hold online meetings using tools like, Zoom.us, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, Slack etc. and do not forget to ask for personal wellbeing, as these are the trying times and a pinch of personal touch will not hurt.</li><li>Add some personalization to your work office space, you should feed inclined and good to be working out of it.</li><li>Take proper breaks, a study suggests that one should take a break of about 10-15 minutes every 90 minutes (about 1 and a half hours) of work. It keeps you fresh and give your bones and muscle chance to stretch.</li></ul> <h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Use of technology for the work from home set up:</h2> <ul> <li>Use productivity and collaboration tools for ease of communications and managing your workflow. Tools like <b>Asana, MS Teams, Trello, Basecamp, Monday.com</b> etc. Can be of tremendous help.</li><li>Track your time spend on each activity that you perform. Even if your organization does not need that, you should know how you are doing. <b>Toggl, Time Doctor, HubStaff,</b> are some of such tools out there. You can do manually as well using a spreadsheet but why do extra work when technology can do it for you.</li><li>We briefly touched upon communication tools in our last section, but background noise can be your biggest challenge while having meeting at home. Besides a good noise cancelling device like <b>Jabra</b>, you can use Krisp, which is great to cancel or at least reduce the background noise during your calls and meetings.</li><li>File sharing is also important, and you want to make sure that you do it with ease and securely. <b>Google Drive, One Drive from Office 365, Dropbox</b> are some of the cloud-based services that can make your file sharing very convenient.</li><li>You may sometime need to access someone’s computer remotely or vice a versa. There are many ways to go about it, but one of the easiest is to use a service like TeamViewer or any desk.</li></ul> <p>At the end we would like to suggest, to keep your mental and physical health at check, spend time with your near and dear ones, keep a work –life balance, surround yourself with positivity, avoid outside visits as much as possible, be careful and keep precautions. Most of all use this time to enhance your skills, getting organized and presenting your best to your organization and family.</p><p>Work from home is fun if you know how to go about it and if you need any sort of consultation, do let us know.

From buying a toothbrush to a new Armani watch, everything and anything is available online. E-commerce platforms are highly competitive and positively impact brand value. Virtual assistant services or staffing companies can help increase the efficiency and increase the market share of such e-commerce businesses.</p><p>Given the versatility and capabilities of a virtual staff or a virtual assistant, the question arises that how exactly a business process outsourcing company will assist the e-commerce business.</p><p>Let us browse through the question by evaluating the operationality of e-commerce. For that, we can categorize them into the 4 P’s:</p><ul> <li><b>Product</b></li><li><b>Platform</b></li><li><b>Process</b></li><li><b>People</b></li></ul> <h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Product</h2> <p>Primarily, this comprises of the offerings given by the e-commerce company to its customers. Virtual staff can work on completing End to End Product Management. If one must define, end-to-product management, then it will certainly include product listing to specializing in product sourcing and product description writing. Big players on the internet which are giant marketplaces, showcase various product options and those products are available with a tap on your screen; with a such multitude of offerings and accessibility, the competitive edge can only be achieved when an e-commerce company creates a unique brand value. So, how would that be achieved?</p><p>The simple answer is working on multiple layers: product availability, product sourcing, and product marketing. This is where a virtual assistant can be brought since they are skilled in product management. You can ask them to order products and manage inventory while simultaneously working on maintaining the traction on the website.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Platform</h2> <p>There is no denial in saying that the website of the company is their operational business. Customers, retailers, marketers, and competitors will access the proficiency of the business through its website. Hence, it is imperative to say that the primary focus should be to continuously design and develop the ‘Platform’.</p><p>Not every business has the capacity to have a humongous team on the likes of Amazon and eBay and to sustain in the cutthroat environment many small to mid-size businesses rely on a stable business process outsourcing partner. The outsourced project can range from web designing or development to working on specialized link builders with Google. Most outsourced tasks include logo and graphic designing, videography, content writing, Ad campaign management, email marketing and specialized PPC, reputation management and mostly, maintaining the look and feel of your online shop.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Process & People</h2> <p>These two terminologies go hand-in-hand for e-commerce businesses. Right from landing on the website page of the company to delivering the product at the door of the customer; a virtual staff can assist in several activities.</p><p>The brand value will be created when the shopping experience of the customer is fully accessible from product range, availability to the payment process. Virtual staff can provide <b>24*7 voice and chat support</b>, work in database management and provide exceptional service in payment gateways. These are guaranteed process for customer retention and invoice generation. However, product satisfaction is still never guaranteed, hence in that case, a virtual staff will also operate in refund management and <a href='<?=$baseurl2?>/customer-support-outsourcing'>customer support</a>.</p><p>The competence of the virtual staff is the essential factor and several BPOs have specialized in tools such as <b>Zendesk, Freshdesk, and Intercom</b> to maximize your ROI through technology.</p><p>To summarize, a virtual assistant can perform several tasks for an e-commerce business. Many BPOs continuously invest in the learning and development of their staff, so that, even if an e-commerce client expects serviceability of a specific niche, the BPO partner will perform. The key is to look for the right BPO partner, the one who engages in shared learning and is willing to outperform themselves with an intention to grow with the client.</p><p>If you need any consultation on how you can utilize a virtual assistant for your online shop or e-commerce business, please do let us know.</p><p><a href='<?=$baseurl2?>/book-free-consultation-call'>Click here for a free consultation.</a></p><p>Happy exploring!</p></div></article> </div></div></div></div><div class='col-md-12 text-center'> <h4 class='font-weight-semibold mb-2 pb-1 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible'> Share this Post</h4></div><div class='share-buttons-container'> <div class='share-list'> <a class='fb-h' onclick='return fbs_click()' target='_blank' title='FACEBOOK'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/facebook-f.png'> </a> <a class='tw-h' onclick='return tbs_click()' target='_blank' title='TWITTER'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/twitter-squared.png'> </a> <a class='li-h' onclick='return lbs_click()' target='_blank' title='LINKEDIN'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/linkedin.png'> </a> <a data-pin-do='buttonPin' data-pin-config='none' class='pi-h' onclick='return pbs_click()' target='_blank' title='PINTEREST'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/90/000000/pinterest.png'> </a> </div></div>",

The ongoing spread of the pandemic has become the most prominent threat to the world’s economies and financial markets. In 2002, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic was known to affect 8098 lives with the recorded death toll of 774.</p><p>Covid 19 is affecting 182 countries, including one international conveyance (cruise ship ‘Diamond Princess’ harbored in Yokohama, Japan). As of March, a total of 81,171 cases of Coronavirus patients are recorded, with 3,277 number of total deaths in different provinces of China.</p><p>Big companies like Google and Twitter have instructed their employees to work from home as a preventive measure. Startups, as well as SMBs, are providing their employees the flexibility to work from home and <a href='https://anunaadlife.com/corona-virus-things-to-have-knowledge-of/' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>stay healthy</a> and safe amidst the pandemic situation.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>How is Coronavirus affecting different industries globally?</h2> <p>Covid-19 is not just a threat to lives, but it’s a severe menace to even the world’s largest economies. The black swan event is shaking up the businesses as well as consumer behavior on a large scale. The immediate and clear impact is a massive disruption to the supply chain as it turns to a complete shut down of factories and manufacturing plants.</p><p>The rapid spread of Coronavirus has put a halt on important tech meetings and conferences, which has caused missed partnership opportunities. Companies are shutting down their operations, and the majority of businesses have opted for work from home to avoid the accidental spread of the scary virus among the employees.</p><p>In the event of a crisis, tech tools have emerged as a silver lining, and companies across the globe are promoting work from home opportunities. Though it seems quite challenging to manage work tasks, family, and kids while working from home, one needs to be manageable and stay productive at the same. But the question here is that ‘how to work from home and keep the kids safe’ during a global health crisis.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Begin with Process Mapping</h2> <p>Process Mapping is outlining the tasks, instructions, and guidelines to accomplish the ongoing remote project. It also includes jotting down the tasks and instructions assigned to other team members involved in the project.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Tools that help Companies Salvage Productivity</h2> <p>Remote work is done best when all the team members work cohesively using Cloud-based tools and apps. Tools such as GSuite, Slack, Asana, Basecamp, Zoom, Teamviewer, Desktime, etc. makes it quite easier to manage work while collaborating with the team members in real-time.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>The Importance of Video Conferencing Tools</h2> <p>In the digital era, the world is connected with advanced technological tools. Employees can interact with each other, and the high-tech video conferencing tools have paved the way for businesses and big corporations to connect seamlessly in a better way. Tools such as Skype for Business, Meeting Owl, Zoom, UberConference, FreeConference, etc. provides a powerful way to enable conferences, presentations, and other videos/audio contents from remote locations.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Collaboration Tools for Business</h2> <p>Collaboration and communication among employees are crucial for better output.

Who is a Virtual Assistant'> </a> </div><div class='post-content ms-0 blog-default'> <p>While running a startup or dealing with the hustle of a growing business, when was the last time you took stock of your productivity? And even after exhausting yourself do you find that when you call it a day and get to your place, you still feel dissatisfied. You have a pending list of items and you couldn’t spare time finding new prospects for your business or that next big idea of yours.</p><p>In a survey, it was found that most of the productive hours of entrepreneurs and executives are wasted on replying to emails and other administrative tasks. We do not often realize, but they clutter up our days and keeps us underperforming. No wonder everyone who realized it must be looking for a solution.</p><p>Fortunately, we all have options that can help us focus on what is more important for us. Hiring staff is always an option but what if you are not yet prepared for hiring someone full-time. It is for sure that you already know about virtual assistants.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>But, want to know more about them?</h2> <p>We all have hesitation about hiring an outsider or someone we do not know. The trust issues of handing over the business activities are genuine. I understand that trusting a stranger or an unknown individual is tough. However, did you know that there are professional organizations that have a structure around virtual assistant services and they back it up with a dependable management team, processes and systems around your tasks and processes?</p><p>I know you might have a lot of questions around virtual assistant services. Let me help you with some basic answers regarding Virtual Assistants.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Who is a Virtual Assistant?</h2> <p>Well, a virtual assistant can be an AI-based app, which can do the very specific tasks set for you, for example booking your calendar or providing you pre-saved information as and when you need it. However, today I am discussing the virtual assistants who are like us, I mean the homo sapiens.</p><p>Virtual Assistants can be freelancers or can be from a managed service provider. These virtual assistants can do a myriad of activities for your business depending upon their skillsets and your business needs. Skill oriented tasks can be like bookkeeping or web designing. But, mostly they are hired and preferred for taking on the repetitive activities of your business process.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>What are virtual assistant companies or managed virtual assistant service providers?</h2> <p>As mentioned above that there are two major categories of virtual assistants, either they are freelancers or they are a part of a managed service provider. The later is mostly a business house offering virtual assistants as their core service. They have a proven strategy supporting the plethora of activities or services which can be done by the virtual assistants.</p><p>The biggest benefit of partnering with a business for virtual assistant service is that you don’t have to rely on one individual for your business activities. Individuals or freelance virtual assistants are good for one-off jobs or small projects. However, when you have an ongoing need for someone who can run your back office, a managed service provider is your best bet. Another advantage is that such companies do not only provide a virtual employee but also give you access to a complete management structure including an accounts manager, operation manager, and quality control team. And, most essentially a backup staff so that you do not have to retrain someone when if ever your primary staff goes AWOL.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>What types of tasks can a virtual assistant handle?</h2> <p>You will be amazed to see the multitude of services that a virtual assistant company can offer to you. A virtual assistant can act as your executive assistant or can also help with your recruitment process. They can help you find business leads and can also run marketing campaigns on your behalf. I will include the most popular services, however, to sum it up I can say if there is any task in your business, which is repetitive, process-centric, doesn’t need a highly skilled attention, or on which you can train someone in a week time or a month, would be the most ideal activity for a virtual assistant to take on for you.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Is there any difference between a Virtual Assistant and an in-house Employee who is made to do the same job?</h2> <p>The answer is yes and no, both.</p><p>Yes, the difference is there. An in-house employee can be very skilled on a certain task, however, a virtual assistant can walk the process your layout. Another difference is the cost when you have an in-house employee you have many compensatory obligations, but with a virtual assistant, there is a fixed monthly cost. And, as the name suggests virtual assistants are virtual, meaning they would work remotely and you do not need an infrastructure for them.</p><p>No, because a virtual assistant too should be considered as your own team member, it’s just that they work virtually. Regular communication, well-maintained processes, consistent feedback can help you build a strong partnership with the virtual assistant service provider.</p><p>Mostly, we suggest businesses to see virtual assistants as an aid to their in-house staff. Virtual Assistant can do the grill and drill activity and your in-house staff can concentrate on high-level business objectives. For example, if your recruiter is spending 90% of your time sourcing candidates and managing the database, you are getting just 10% of productive time to close a job. However, if you have a virtual assistant to help your recruiter with sourcing, the recruiter’s entire time can be spent on closing a job.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>What industries or businesses a virtual assistant can work in?</h2> <p>Again, anything that can be done and worked upon under a roof on a computer system. It also excludes tasks that need specialized skills like designing a floor plan or budgeting for your business. However, E-commerce, Recruitment, Healthcare, Insurance, Hospitality, Event Management, Real Estate, Legal Services are only a few to mention.Your industry compatibility isn’t the right way to see if a virtual assistant can be of help to you or not. You need to identify the most recurring and day-to-day process-centric activities.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>“We as businessmen need to understand that we can be jack of all trades but that leaves us as master of none.”</h2> <p>Our time is precious and we should spend it putting more efforts to reach our goals. If we are working alone or are too focused on certain pedestrian activities, we are merely working within our business and not on our business.This not being the only list of questions, I will come up with more of these in the virtual assistant series. You can also write to me personally for any questions you may have.</p></div></article> </div></div></div></div><div class='col-md-12 text-center'> <h4 class='font-weight-semibold mb-2 pb-1 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible'> Share this Post</h4></div><div class='share-buttons-container'> <div class='share-list'> <a class='fb-h' onclick='return fbs_click()' target='_blank' title='FACEBOOK'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/facebook-f.png'> </a> <a class='tw-h' onclick='return tbs_click()' target='_blank' title='TWITTER'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/twitter-squared.png'> </a> <a class='li-h' onclick='return lbs_click()' target='_blank' title='LINKEDIN'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/linkedin.png'> </a> <a data-pin-do='buttonPin' data-pin-config='none' class='pi-h' onclick='return pbs_click()' target='_blank' title='PINTEREST'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/90/000000/pinterest.png'> </a> </div></div>",

Fast forward to today, and social media has evolved from a just networking channel to a holistic platform with potent marketing tools. The wealth of marketing opportunities afforded by social media is by every means far-reaching, just ask bestproducts.com who upped their number of monthly web visitors to over 600,000 all thanks to social media marketing techniques. But like social media itself, social media strategies evolve over time. Curious about what would be the rave for social media in 2018, here’s a quick sneak peek.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Mobile technologies lead the pack</h2> <p>If there’s one thing we’ve come to realize over the years, it’s the now common knowledge that mobile-based technology is slowly but steadily outranking other platforms for consumer engagement. As of February 2017, approx. 50% of all web users accessed the web from their mobile devices; Instagram, Snapchat, and other mobile-based social media networks also witnessed a marked increase in the number of active users. The import from this prevailing scenario is that businesses seeking competitive advantage must up their mobile content and mobile advertising game. Companies must now invest considerable resources and time in the development of content enhanced for mobile integration, which leads to the next point.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Businesses must churn out richer content to stand out</h2> <p>The hard truth is that virtually everyone is doing social media marketing now – small companies, startup, mega businesses, you name it. And as a result, social media is currently saturated with a plethora of mundane ads targeting the increasingly ‘ads-desensitized’ social media users. If you aim to get user engagement, then you must develop richer content because after all as they say content is king. Low-level content does not generate conversions anymore; you could spend years forcing bland material down the throat of consumers, but trust us, they won’t swallow. Quality content is just as valuable (if not more important) than the actual advertisement campaign.</p><p>As far as the metrics go, for now, quality content presented as a video is what’s deriving the conversion. That said other forms of user engagement could be potentially disruptive. You just have to put on your thinking cap and get creative.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>You’ll need to put more work into your social media Campaign</h2> <p>Social media marketing is serious business, but many fail to see it that way. To some, it is just a casual way of bolstering market reach, to others it’s a promising prospect that’s too stressful to manipulate and to the sect, we like to call ‘wise’ it’s an invaluable tool that generates the majority of their business leads. Which one are you? For social media to work for your business, you have to commit considerable effort and time to your marketing strategies. And while this might seem unfeasible given your current workload, it is something that can be achieved by delegating such tasks to virtual assistants and remote staffs at a fraction of the cost it’ll take to hire an onsite team. Nothing good comes easy, and social media marketing is a case example of a tree that won’t yield fruit unless it is watered properly.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Last but not least, it’s time to delve into Influencer marketing</h2> <p>People trust opinions and suggestions if it’s coming from ‘people’ like them not from the content producers themselves. No one expects you to speak ill of your product, so anything you say about it is taken with a pinch of salt. Influencer marketing orchestrated subtly and indirectly polishes your brand with that ‘peoples favorite’ sheen.</p></div></article> </div></div></div></div><div class='col-md-12 text-center'> <h4 class='font-weight-semibold mb-2 pb-1 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible'> Share this Post</h4></div><div class='share-buttons-container'> <div class='share-list'> <a class='fb-h' onclick='return fbs_click()' target='_blank' title='FACEBOOK'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/facebook-f.png'> </a> <a class='tw-h' onclick='return tbs_click()' target='_blank' title='TWITTER'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/twitter-squared.png'> </a> <a class='li-h' onclick='return lbs_click()' target='_blank' title='LINKEDIN'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/linkedin.png'> </a> <a data-pin-do='buttonPin' data-pin-config='none' class='pi-h' onclick='return pbs_click()' target='_blank' title='PINTEREST'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/90/000000/pinterest.png'> </a> </div></div>",

Now as technology is evolving and the future is looking more advanced, every business person needs to adopt the growing technological schemes to expand their boundaries. However, the future is unpredictable, but if we analyze the developments that are occurring, we can expect a more streamlined human and machine interface in the upcoming years.</p><p>As one of the leading business process outsourcing companies, we suggest you change your present to adopt the future. Here are some of the advanced technological breaches or trends that will transform the world in 2019:</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Artificial Intelligence</h2> <p>Most major organizations are now adopting Artificial intelligence (AI) to provide their customers with more interactive features. It will deliver better interactivity and customer experience. Some of the best examples of AI are Google Maps and GPS Insight which have remarkably changed the system of operations of several companies. Businesses are also trying to experiment with the automation process to meet the users’ expectations.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Live Interactions over Social Media</h2> <p>Tweeting and blogging are no longer enough. Live interactions are something that can actually bring the communities together. Several pieces of evidence advocate that live videos engage more than recorded videos. Community events such as the B2B forum also interact with the users while offering social learning which goes beyond what social platforms are providing. In order to build brand loyalty, you must adopt live interactions which can make it easy for your customers to communicate with you directly.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Live Streaming Videos</h2> <p>Modern customers don’t prefer seeing generic marketing content as they want to get more engaged and connected. You can consider coming up with live streaming videos to hook your potential clients in 2019. Live streaming provides your business with a powerful channel to engage the target audience. Recent research held by Livestream also reveals that 80% of people would like to watch live videos rather than reading a 1000 words blog which has already been written by many writers. Companies that introduce their products through live videos will dominate their industries in 2019.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Blockchain</h2> <p>You must have heard about Blockchain which is known as the growing technology, upholding fewer adoption which is rooted in its techno-babble jargon. IBM has already created an alliance with Costco, Nestle, and Walmart to boost the efficiency of global food supply chain safety. The Blockchain technologies will introduce more development in the digital transactions which will definitely interrupt conventional business schemes for more streamlined processes. Growing businesses need to improve their skills around this technology to stay ahead of the competition.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Serving Community Not Only Buyers</h2> <p>Today, the initial idea of selling to only buyers has completely changed. Instead of just selling, every seller needs to serve new models of consumers. You need to gear yourself for a more socially oriented approach and establish trust networks. As an aspiring business owner, you must attain social and environmental responsibility while developing a responsive culture. Build yourself as an influencer and make your brand a life-changing product.</p><p>Whether you are involved in e-commerce or digital marketing, you must consider all these business trends in 2018-2019. Customers are becoming smarter every day and you must fulfill their advanced expectations. You need to make smart choices with the latest industry trends and reach the audience with more innovative endowments.</p><p>If you are looking to make your business process more streamlined, you have come to the right place.

It is especially hard when these tasks are so boring due to being mundane and repetitive. There are only 24 hours in a day anyway and you cannot possibly do every single task within that time if you’re pulling a one-man-show. Now, what is the solution then? <b>A remote staff</b> this right here is the answer to all your worries as an entrepreneur. Hire one with research expertise to cut down your work while benefiting the company. Let us have a look through all the tasks you can get your remote staff to do.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Save time</h2> <p>Do you have the time to go through long <b>prospect lists</b>? I’m pretty sure you don’t. Get a virtual assistant of remote staff to go through the long <b>prospect list</b>. Hire staff to investigate the details and figure out who from the long prospect list is actually a target audience and who is not.

You can trust your remote staff for contact sourcing as well as to mark your bookings in the calendar too. Just right there you got rid of so much workload.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Marketing</h2> <p>Campaigning is a vital aspect of any company. Unfortunately, you cannot go out and conduct this process on your own. As important as it is, you need to hire the right lead generation staff to conduct this process. A virtual assistant will work from your email marketing to your social media marketing. The remote staff will do the campaigning by sending out newsletter emails to potential clients. They will also keep up with existing clients. Alongside this, the virtual staff will help maintain good customer relations as well by doing things like sending out thank you emails. As for <b>database building</b>, a good virtual assistant will send out forms for the clients to fill in. With this information, the virtual assistant will be able to maintain a good database collection as well.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Social media and search engine optimization</h2> <p>Other than email marketing, remote staff also works for search engine marketing and social media marketing. For this part of <b>campaigning</b> regarding the business, they will post SEO content. The regular website analysis will help you improve your official website and the content too. A virtual assistant will be able to get you good traffic by using effective marketing methods. As for social media, regular updates and good quality content are vital. Hiring a remote staff for this task is highly beneficial. Since you can’t sit around spending hours creating user-friendly content, the virtual assistant will do it for you. They will also keep up with customer engagement like replying to messages, responding to comments, considering the complaints, etc. These little things will immensely improve your business repute.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Other marketing</h2> <p>Now, a business does have to keep up with existing clientele. There are a lot of follow-ups to be made. You need to convince customers to re-hire you as well. A virtual assistant good at contact sourcing will be able to fulfill this task easily. They will also be good at answering customer queries. Best of all they will not have to rush through it at all because they have all the time dedicated to these tasks only. Whether you need rental space or new office buildings, your virtual assistant can do the research they will bring you brochures.

Long story short, you will not have anything to worry about!</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Blog maintenance</h2> <p>By this time, we all know the importance of having a well-maintained blog. However, it is a time-consuming procedure. This is a task your remote staff can do very well. Your VA can regularly update your blog content or post SEO content on the website for generating traffic for your website. He can post regarding the business updates to keep customers well informed. Alongside, the VA can research more content for engagement. For example, they will have the time to look for relevant videos or images to make your blog more interactive. As for regular blog topics, that will also be sorted out by the hired remote staff. Basically, a hired remote staff can manage your blog perfectly to bring you way more leads than you could do on your own.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Networking</h2> <p>You know what else can change your business other than good marketing? It’s networking. Having good relations, whether it is with customers or with other businesses, is the oxygen for your business. Some connections you will have to make yourself by going to events or seminars but keeping in touch with them eats a lot of time- which could be taken care by your VA if you just provide him the list of screenshots of the business cards collected, so he can just send a thank you note to all of them. Your virtual assistant can keep up a positive relationship and maintain existing contacts too. Your remote staff may also list out certain important networking events for you.</p><p>That sums up some of the benefits you can get from your hired virtual assistant. You can say goodbye to the everyday mundane tasks that take up most of your time and simply trust your virtual assistant for tasks ranging from <b>database building</b> to <a href='<?=$baseurl2?>/bpm-outsourcing-services'>contact sourcing</a>. Your life will become much easier and your business will gain a lot of benefits, too!</p></div></article> </div></div></div></div><div class='col-md-12 text-center'> <h4 class='font-weight-semibold mb-2 pb-1 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible'> Share this Post</h4></div><div class='share-buttons-container'> <div class='share-list'> <a class='fb-h' onclick='return fbs_click()' target='_blank' title='FACEBOOK'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/facebook-f.png'> </a> <a class='tw-h' onclick='return tbs_click()' target='_blank' title='TWITTER'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/twitter-squared.png'> </a> <a class='li-h' onclick='return lbs_click()' target='_blank' title='LINKEDIN'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/linkedin.png'> </a> <a data-pin-do='buttonPin' data-pin-config='none' class='pi-h' onclick='return pbs_click()' target='_blank' title='PINTEREST'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/90/000000/pinterest.png'> </a> </div></div>",

Whether you are a company starting up or one seeking growth, you need to equip your business adequately to realize real growth and development. There are many factors to be put into consideration, most of which are influenced positively through delegating jobs. Here are the necessities for the growth of any business:</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Employees</h2> <p>You cannot run a business if you do not have a team to get the wheels turning. If you are running a new business, it may be tedious to get qualified employees immediately to kick-start the company. Since it is necessary that your business starts moving quickly, you can build a team to kick-start your operations by hiring remote assistants to take up the positions that do not require physical presence at the workplace. It is a plus for you because the virtual staff isn’t only cheap but you get skilled workers who are readily available to work.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Business Connections</h2> <p>Businesses need connections for business partnerships.

With a virtual team, however, you can have remote assistants spread out through different countries especially from India and Philippines – just to mention a few of the top most rated countries offering virtual assistants services. Transfer responsibility to these reliable, professional employees to handle the company’s e-commerce and networking.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Steady Customer Service</h2> <p>As you seek to increase the number of clients seeking your service, you will need a dedicated team to handle customers’ inquiries. Many companies have chosen to move their customer service services overseas to countries such as India or the Philippines. You can hire remote workers to manage your clients while your in-house employees handle those who are physically present.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Social Media Marketing</h2> <p>In this digital age, just having a website is not enough, your presence is significantly important too to showcase your company on social media as best you can. Else you might end up regressing in the business world. Get the best-trained people on the internet through opting remote staff – those who have the best expertise in creating the most attractive social profile for your company. Hiring virtual staff is relatively cheaper and surer option for your business.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Advanced Software and CRM System</h2> <p>Any business requires a functional, efficient and up-to-date software & a team to cope up with those every day updating technologies. You need the best technological equipment set up to run all areas of your business such as QuickBooks, Infusionsoft, Zoho, Mailchimp, emailing tools and much more. Virtual staffing companies today have teams readily available to take on these portals almost immediately and keep your business up to date with the changing technologies. You can hire a remote team of experts to keep your data safe from hackers, viruses or even damage and loss of data.</p><p>Through delegating such activities remotely, you can keep yourself ahead of your competitors & make the most out of these must-haves for your company.</p><p>After all, focusing on core business activities is what you should be doing above these.</p><p>Reference links:</p><p><a href='http://www.bitrebels.com/lifestyle/must-haves-for-successful-business/' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>http://www.bitrebels.com/lifestyle/must-haves-for-successful-business/</a></p></div></article> </div></div></div></div><div class='col-md-12 text-center'> <h4 class='font-weight-semibold mb-2 pb-1 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible'> Share this Post</h4></div><div class='share-buttons-container'> <div class='share-list'> <a class='fb-h' onclick='return fbs_click()' target='_blank' title='FACEBOOK'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/facebook-f.png'> </a> <a class='tw-h' onclick='return tbs_click()' target='_blank' title='TWITTER'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/twitter-squared.png'> </a> <a class='li-h' onclick='return lbs_click()' target='_blank' title='LINKEDIN'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/linkedin.png'> </a> <a data-pin-do='buttonPin' data-pin-config='none' class='pi-h' onclick='return pbs_click()' target='_blank' title='PINTEREST'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/90/000000/pinterest.png'> </a> </div></div>",

When you are working 24*7, there are so many tasks which keep your business/company running. Sometimes, due to the hectic schedule, you might tend to miss out on something or the other. Besides, you have to spend a huge amount of money on resources highly required to streamline all the monotonous tasks. This also leaves you with a very little time for other core important duties.</p><p>What can be the solution for the above-mentioned issues? Outsourcing! There is a myriad of business activities and chores that one can outsource to save time as well as money. This shall give you ample amount of time for cooking up some new ideas for your business.</p><p>Thinking about what all tasks can you outsource? Let us make it easier for you. Enlisted are the services you can outsource.</p><p>Business activities you can outsource:</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Customer service</h2> <p>This is not just a very time-consuming errand, but the most outsourced one too! A lot of people are already outsourcing customer service and if you aren’t one, it’s time to consider it. An adroit person can help not only for giving support to the customers but also can convert the leads into sales. Especially for product-based companies, customer service can be outsourced instead of deploying a huge staff.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Graphics Designing</h2> <p>From a simple task like making a logo to social media graphics, there always will be a need for graphics for your business. Instead of hiring a highly-paid graphic designer you can outsource this work, especially if you are a startup. Small businesses tend to outsource designing a lot as this saves time, money and also a bunch of brain-storming.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Accounting and other financial tasks</h2> <p>Tasks like accounting and book-keeping are things one can easily outsource. This would be beneficial especially for bigger businesses. Outsourced services would include book-keeping, invoicing and accounts payable and receivable, as well as financial reporting, analysis, and planning.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Human resources</h2> <p>Your Human Resource can easily be maintained by an outside firm. There are firms which are quite equipped with plans for advertising, filtering applications and employee acquisition. Employing an HR to manage employee benefits can also be wise, but you can always outsource these services for greater benefits.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Payroll Processing</h2> <p>Business process outsourcing companies alone can save a lot of your hours and money. There are numerous requirements, regulations and tax laws in payroll processing and if these are done by your business, might consume a lot of your expense. Not just this, a single mistake with payroll can generate tax audits and cost your business a ton of money.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Content writing</h2> <p>This service is highly outsourced and a lot of companies do this. Outsourcing content generation can help you in saving hours and money, as the content is a cumbersome task. Not just this, content is the king for any business to grow. Giving it to the experts would make more sense rather than doing something which incurs a loss.</p><p>You can outsource all these business activities and save your time, money, and efforts. Global business consulting services or outsourcing companies will help you release workload and concentrate on other essential tasks.</p></div></article> </div></div></div></div><div class='col-md-12 text-center'> <h4 class='font-weight-semibold mb-2 pb-1 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible'> Share this Post</h4></div><div class='share-buttons-container'> <div class='share-list'> <a class='fb-h' onclick='return fbs_click()' target='_blank' title='FACEBOOK'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/facebook-f.png'> </a> <a class='tw-h' onclick='return tbs_click()' target='_blank' title='TWITTER'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/twitter-squared.png'> </a> <a class='li-h' onclick='return lbs_click()' target='_blank' title='LINKEDIN'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/linkedin.png'> </a> <a data-pin-do='buttonPin' data-pin-config='none' class='pi-h' onclick='return pbs_click()' target='_blank' title='PINTEREST'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/90/000000/pinterest.png'> </a> </div></div>",

Most small-scale companies and startups fail to achieve desired success due to lack of planning and creativity. Well, 2018 can be the year when you can correct all your mistakes and take your business to a new level.</p><p>Let’s have a look at some of the most powerful and result-driven strategies that every entrepreneur should consider in 2018:</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Focus on the Most Crucial Thing</h2> <p>One of the most significant challenges with managing a small business is the distraction which often arises from the desire to wear many hats. Being a growing business owner, you may not have the financial strength to hire experts, so you’ll often find yourself being the recruiter, marketer, accountant, and lawyer of your own business at the same time. Pieces of evidence advocate that “multitasking” can severely wreck your progress and put you out of the market. So, you need to stop being a multitasker and put all your power on your business goal. If required, employ top talent with essential skill sets to improve other areas.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Set Sales Target</h2> <p>When you don’t have any target goal, it’s difficult to achieve great success. By setting an annual or monthly sales goal, you can prepare powerful marketing strategies and encourage the sales team to reach the target. If you have a solid plan and a set amount, your team will be determined to accomplish them. Sit with your marketing and sales team and plan a layout, set up the targets and ways to achieve it.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Choose the Right Tools</h2> <p>Apart from hiring professionals for your small business, you also need to choose the right tools that will help you accelerate the growth. If properly used, such tools will help you boost your productivity and reach your goals faster. For instance, Social media is one of the most time-consuming tasks that demand constant observation. Automating your social media can help you reduce the time spent on promoting your products or services. You can use Hootsuite, Buffer, or other popular tools to schedule your posts on different channels.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Outsource Monotonous Activities</h2> <p>Depending on your requirement, outsourcing may be an efficient alternative to the in-house team. You can outsource accounting, bookkeeping, recruitment, CRM management, data entry, and other time-consuming tasks. In several cases, it will make more sense to delegate specific activities to virtual assistants. With the help of a reliable business process consultant, you will be able to save your money while streamlining all the procedures.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Update Your Website</h2> <p>Your website is your online identity which helps you get leads and attract customers. You need to make sure that your website is fully responsive and works flawlessly on all kind of mobile devices. Also, take a look at the UX and navigation of your site. How long does it take to load? Here, you also need to take a look at user behavior using Google Analytics. If users are showing less interest in your service or dropping, then you probably need to update your website.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Create Wider Network</h2> <p>As an aspiring businessman, you need to think about making a resolution to expand your business circle. By creating a more extensive network, you can get several business opportunities. You need to connect with people having experience of running a successful business. You will find a large number of communities and networking groups online and offline; start connecting with them. It’s recommended to join groups on Facebook and other platforms which will keep you up-to-date on what’s happening with other businesses in your sector.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Re-Evaluate Your Social Media Strategy</h2> <p>In this fast-growing digital world, you need to keep yourself up to date. You need to provide your target audience with fresh and engaging content. Make sure to evaluate your <a href='<?=$baseurl2?>/blog/top-social-media-strategies-for-2018'>social media strategy</a> on a regular basis. Instead of blowing money on paid advertising, you should use free online tools or platforms that lead you directly to your audience. You can effectively promote your website using Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, Instagram, and other platforms. Remember, creative posts and useful content never fails to engage the users.</p><p>All these 7 tips mentioned above will help you stay ahead of the game and make your business highly successful in 2018.

Besides, they are also leading the way when it comes to developing their capabilities with outsourcing. With reliable outsourcing companies, several businesses from the USA achieved to streamline their business process while lowering operational cost.</p><p>Today, most startups and well-established companies choose global business consulting services or outsourcing due to their associated advantages and lower risks. In this blog, we will discuss 4 reasons why most Americans go with business process outsourcing companies:</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Achieve More with Less</h2> <p>Every business i.e. small, medium or large keeps going under continuous pressure to produce an increased amount of productivity to generate more ROI using the existing workforce. However, it’s not easy to keep the balance between quality and quantity with the available staff. With outsourcing, you get access to a well-skilled team of experts who is capable of delivering quality work. You can easily achieve higher productivity at an affordable cost and without hiring more staff.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Focus on Core Competencies</h2> <p>When your business grows or company expands, you need to ramp up your support infrastructure to come up with better service. But, how to manage expanding customer base? How to come up with better solutions, new products, and test them? And, how to meet increasing demands while maintaining your current growth rate? Outsourcing enables you to delegate non-productive tasks and lets you keep your focus on core activities. You can delegate all those monotonous activities such as data entry, customer support, bookkeeping or accounting, recruitment, and focus on core competencies.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Flexibility when Negotiating Contracts</h2> <p>There is no doubt that American labor is expensive and the cost of living is high while comparing to other countries. Apart from employees’ salary, there is the expense of taxes, computers, cubicles, health & liability insurance, and other resources depending on the perks you grant. With business process outsourcing, you get well-skilled experts at an economical price which can also be negotiated. Pricing flexibility empowers you to efficiently manage your budget when you can’t afford a high-priced in-house team.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Higher Value per Person</h2> <p>Managing a proper staff level to meet the business demands is a tricky art to master. With a little staff, your business is associated with the risk of failing to deliver quality work on time. You can hire a powerful in-house team who is capable of meeting the increased demands 70 percent of the time. If activity spikes due to seasonal demands, you can add bandwidth to your organization through outsourcing. This will help you manage utilization rate throughout the year, leading to a higher value obtained per person as you dramatically diminish the “nonproductive” time originated by staff sitting in your company.</p><p>The economy of the United States continues to undergo notable change due to growing competition. In this highly-competitive online market, it is a wise decision to go with business process outsourcing companies. In the end, you will find your business in a position to generate more profit and net income and continue business productivity.</p></div></article> </div></div></div></div><div class='col-md-12 text-center'> <h4 class='font-weight-semibold mb-2 pb-1 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible'> Share this Post</h4></div><div class='share-buttons-container'> <div class='share-list'> <a class='fb-h' onclick='return fbs_click()' target='_blank' title='FACEBOOK'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/facebook-f.png'> </a> <a class='tw-h' onclick='return tbs_click()' target='_blank' title='TWITTER'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/twitter-squared.png'> </a> <a class='li-h' onclick='return lbs_click()' target='_blank' title='LINKEDIN'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/linkedin.png'> </a> <a data-pin-do='buttonPin' data-pin-config='none' class='pi-h' onclick='return pbs_click()' target='_blank' title='PINTEREST'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/90/000000/pinterest.png'> </a> </div></div>",

Most business owners are aware that if they are involved in various monotonous tasks and small business issues, they will never be able to concentrate on the more essential activities of their organizations. This is where business process consultant or outsourcing comes in.</p><p>Business process outsourcing allows companies to lessen the burden of work and focus on other core aspects of their offices. Outsourcing to an offshore company, which is already well-established and consists of a highly experienced team of experts, is a much more economical option. Being a business owner, you can use this service as a strategic initiative to revamp customer service, improve quality of work, and reduce costs.</p><p>Outsourcing is a powerful business asset which is used by millions of companies worldwide. With these services, you get an opportunity to work with highly-professional virtual assistants. Here are some of the advantages of hiring a business process consultant in USA.:</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Cost reduction</h2> <p>Lowering costs has always been the main benefit of outsourcing. Direct savings are achieved by the difference in salaries, secondary conditions and operational expenses between most Western countries and offshore locations such as India, China, and the Philippines. Indirect savings are often possible because the companies can once again focus on their core activity and outsource secondary processes to a specialized service provider.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Expertise</h2> <p>Through outsourcing, you gain access to expertise that you may not have in your company. Instead of setting up a creative design department yourself, you can outsource the web design and the development of marketing materials to specialized agencies. In the old economy, large companies had a department per business requirement. In the current network economy, companies re-focus on their core business and leave the rest to a network of external partners.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Availability</h2> <p>In certain sectors, it can be very difficult to find people who have the right skills and want to join you. A good example is the ICT sector. But few small businesses manage to find and hire .NET developers. Outsourcing offers a solution because a company has access to high-quality expertise at such an affordable price.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Flexible Capacity Management</h2> <p>By outsourcing, you can better manage your capacity and occupancy. The hiring of personnel is left to an external service provider with whom you make agreements about quantitative and qualitative results, the number of hours and/or other obligations.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Extra Utilization Of Time Zones</h2> <p>When engaging external service providers, you can take advantage of different time zones than those of your own company. In offshoring locations such as India, people are prepared to work outside regular office hours. A 24/7/365 activity is usually easier to set up offshore.</p><p>So, these are some of the advantages of hiring remote staff services in USA. If you choose a reliable offshore company, outsourcing can be an ideal way to learn better quality techniques and streamline your business process.

In the past 8 years, we have successfully served several clients from USA, and UK.</p><p><a href='<?=$baseurl2?>/book-free-consultation-call'>Book a free consultation call with the experts today!</a></p></div></article> </div></div></div></div><div class='col-md-12 text-center'> <h4 class='font-weight-semibold mb-2 pb-1 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible'> Share this Post</h4></div><div class='share-buttons-container'> <div class='share-list'> <a class='fb-h' onclick='return fbs_click()' target='_blank' title='FACEBOOK'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/facebook-f.png'> </a> <a class='tw-h' onclick='return tbs_click()' target='_blank' title='TWITTER'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/twitter-squared.png'> </a> <a class='li-h' onclick='return lbs_click()' target='_blank' title='LINKEDIN'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/linkedin.png'> </a> <a data-pin-do='buttonPin' data-pin-config='none' class='pi-h' onclick='return pbs_click()' target='_blank' title='PINTEREST'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/90/000000/pinterest.png'> </a> </div></div>",

In this edition, we are also going to talk about ideal tasks to delegate, training of virtual assistants, and what results to expect.</p><p>Here, we go…</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Bringing them on board</h2> <p>I would estimate around a 3-week on-boarding period with your virtual assistant to train them on the tasks you’re handing over and giving them a chance to familiarize themselves with the business.</p><h3 class='text-dark text-bold'>Step 1</h3> <p>Welcome them! Making them feel like the part of the team is vital with a welcome message and a call on their first day. Do it via Skype, Google Hangout, or other online communication if a phone call is not feasible.</p><h3 class='text-dark text-bold'>Step 2</h3> <p>It involves a training session where you need to walk through the tasks and processes; they will be handling. During the process, the virtual assistant can put up questions that you need to answer.</p><h3 class='text-dark text-bold'>Step 3</h3> <p>Also, you should create a checklist of steps which the virtual assistants can take as the reference to go back again for any questions. We use zoom.us for this, it works best for recording the screen activity while you perform the tasks. It is one of the best communications and screen sharing tool we have worked with so far.</p><h3 class='text-dark text-bold'>Step 4</h3> <p>Create a list of tasks ready. Ideally, tasks can be broken down into weekly, daily, and monthly basis. It is also helpful to determine the priority of the activities so that everyone is on the same page.</p><h3 class='text-dark text-bold'>Step 5</h3> <p>Be available. It will be great if you stay logged in on Skype or any preferred IM just in case the virtual assistant has questions for you. It may not be important later but initially, it is essential to gain a better understanding of the tasks. We believe communication is the key to have a successful onboarding.</p><h3 class='text-dark text-bold'>Step 6</h3> <p>Continue to build and grow the relationships with the virtual assistants. You can delegate different tasks that you have going on and make them feel like a part of the business – as they already are.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Tasks for Delegation</h2> <p>Although there are myriad of things you want the virtual assistant to do, it might get difficult to mention them all when being asked. What you can do is… for one straight week, write down everything that you do in a day.It will also help in segregating items that are time-consuming, items that need to be kept within the to-do list and items to be removed.</p><p><b>Here is a comprehensive list of things that you might want to delegate it to the virtual assistant:</b></p><ul> <li>Scheduling social media posts</li><li>Updating membership sites</li><li>Gathering data and doing research based on the requirement</li><li>Inbox management (sorting emails and replying to emails)</li><li>Content updated on the website (you should provide content)</li><li>Calendar management/customer relationship management</li></ul> <h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Training the Virtual Assistant</h2> <p>The training of your virtual assistant is one of the essential things to do. After hiring, you probably know what are the tasks that you’ll be delegating to them. And for that, you must keep aside some free time to train your new staff.</p><p>When you start working with the virtual assistant, try to answer a maximum of the questions. Start with the daily tasks, then move to the weekly and then miscellaneous for guiding on each session.</p><p>Wait for a second! If you think you don’t have enough time to be doing something like this for 2-3 weeks? Listen up as it is crucial. You will surely have 30 minutes – 1 hour for a few weeks to train someone who will be instrumental for your business growth.</p><p><b>So, what do you think? Does the process seem overwhelming? Time-consuming? Completely worth it? But, it is worth every second.</b></p><p>If you are planning to take the magical experience of hiring a virtual assistant, Fusion Business Solution is your go-to business partner.

Executives have recognized that keeping operational functions in-house is not always the most efficient practice. As a result, business functions have been outsourced to a greater extent than in the past. The outsourced accounting services and payroll functions is no exception.</p><p><b>Outsourced accounting</b> has become a popular option for small and medium-sized enterprises that want to lower overheads without compromising efficiency. Many business owners use the savings in overhead costs by hiring outsourced accounting professionals and accounting support services with high levels of expertise to take advantage of savings.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>What Does Outsourcing The Accounting Capacity Mean?</h2> <p>When the right organization is selected for outsourcing, the functions can sometimes be customized, and a part stays with the company. Companies with the limited resources and infrastructure to manage accounting and payroll functions can turn to other companies for expert help. Smaller companies may find this beneficial if they are not prepared to take on these functions. It could also be attractive for larger companies that want to save on staff retention.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Major Benefits of Outsourcing:</h2> <ul class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <li> <b>Cost Saving:</b> <p>Recruitment and maintenance of accounting staff can be costly. Due to the specialized nature of accounting and payroll processing, it may require several employees to perform certain functions. Accounting Directives require that each function must have its own internal control purpose, which requires additional staff. Companies often ignore the cost-effectiveness of outsourcing because they do consider the cost of providing benefits to full-time employees. If you outsource, you do not pay the equivalent amount that you pay to an in-house full-time employee. Consideration must also be given to eliminating social benefits, training, office equipment, time, and taxes.</p></li><li> <b>Expertise:</b> <p>Outsourcing partners will have access to individuals and companies with knowledge of the various business experiences and processes required to smooth accounting functioning. Companies that provide outsourcing and bookkeeping support services invest heavily in human resources. You have employees with expertise in accounting and payroll. These skills are available to their customers. They often provide guidance and advice on how to improve accounting processes.</p></li><li> <b>Flexibility:</b> <p>A company can design a process to retain as much control as it has with an internal accounting group. The company can help decide on payroll deadlines, monthly closing dates, approval processes and workflows. Companies that perform outsourcing accounting functions tend to have a more flexible structure and schedule than their customers. When the opportunity presents itself, the company can exercise control over how the process is defined.</p></li><li> <b>Focus:</b> <p>The reporting and analysis side of the company takes up a lot of valuable time in management. As the outsourcing team keeps an eye on maintaining accurate and compliant books, management can keep a check on managing the business. Managers can focus on business opportunities instead of managing internal accounting processes.</p></li><li> <b>Teamwork:</b> <p>When a company decides to outsource its accounting, it expands its team by adding additional specialists. As for comfort and self-confidence increase, their team’s insights can prove invaluable. The right outsourcing company should be seen as an extension of the company’s resources.</p></li></ul> <h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Choosing a Partner?</h2> <p><b>Things to consider when choosing an outsourced accounting ﬁrm:</b></p><ul class='text-3-5 pb-0 mb-2 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible textUL' data-appear-animation='fadeInUpShorter' data-appear-animation-delay='500' style='animation-delay: 500ms;'> <li> <b>Experience:</b> <p>a.

Companies no more require establishing big offices in large metropolitan; only a small office area with primary business operations can do. They can access talent for mundane jobs from anywhere in the world. And with the development of collaborative tools and technology, it is very convenient to work with a virtual or distributed team.</p><p>However, the distance doesn’t prove to be decisive for the success of the team every time. It can even cause a lack of coordination and proper communication resulting in poor work culture and lower productivity in the long run. But, these drawbacks are nothing in front of several benefits attached to remote team.</h2> <p>To ensure a good work culture and high-level productivity, you need to put down a few practices.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Communicate, Communicate, Communicate</h2> <p>Regardless of how thoroughly you and your team follow professionalism, emails can be missed by anyone. Missing an important email can put a halt on a crucial project update, cause a delay in project delivery because the team member could not get clarification on the issue they were experiencing.</p><p>But, also it is essential to realize the work hours of your remote employees. Most people working at a remote location feel burdened of staying available during the entire day. The obligation to respond to work messages is not a good sign. It is significant to communicate regarding the work hours at the very first place.</p><p><b>“Frequent communication can be a challenge for newly established remote teams. But, the collaboration tools like Zoom, Slack, Skype and many more incredibly helps the team members to interact and speak on important project updates or questions, wherever and whenever.”– Kuldeep Bhatnagar</b></p><p><b>(Assistant General Manager at Fusion Business Solutions)</b></p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Focus on Upskilling</h2> <p>A happy and productive team is the one that is always willing to take up new skills. You must motivate the remote staff to seek more knowledge and leverage for personal and professional growth. Because, when your team is equipped with new skills, it will work for the benefit of the organization as well. They can deliver exceptional work every time.</p><p>This also work very well in retaining your armed force. You can make them realize that you value them and want them to learn for their personal good. One way is to provide them free access to online courses at Coursera or Udemy. These online training platforms provide a range of courses that can help your team upskill after work hours or per their comfort.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Introduce your Culture</h2> <p>Do not forget, your virtual employees are a part of your organization and should feel it just like your in-house employees. Apart from the work, talk about your culture, seasonal changes, local communities, festival, and trends. It is one way your remote teams will feel warm and happy to work with you in the long run.</p><p>Moreover, when you introduce your culture you lay down a foundation of trust and unity with your remote team. It doesn’t take much of an effort but exchanging festival greetings can make a big difference to the commitment and quality of the work that is delivered.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Emphasize on “what”, rather than “when”</h2> <p>Is it important that your calendar is well-planned or that it gets completed only when you are available? Of course, time isn’t a significant factor if you get a productive advantage during your off-hours.</p><p>In other words, if your virtual team can work correctly during your night time and if it doesn’t have much to do with the frequent communication, allow them to bring the best in their comfortable time zone. Let your remote team stay happy and productive (not burdened with restrictions).</p><p>Though, remote teams are specialized in turning their schedule as per yours. And, they make sure the transition is smooth even if they work during the night time.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Let There Be Trust</h2> <p>Micromanaging every step of your remote team can turn as counterproductive for the organization. Broadly, if you keep worrying about the work your remote staff is doing, cycling your brains on the less important, you need to change your approach.</p><p>Set down clear expectations, long term objectives, and only then a mutual sense of trust is able to build. Once it is understood that what quality of work is expected, what things are due, and the foundation of trust is laid down there itself.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>The Final Word</h2> <p>The successful virtual offices maintain a series of processes and technologies to collaborate and maintain good terms with the client company.</p><p>Virtual teams may come and go. But, by following a few tips, you can create a sustainable partnership that can align with your organizational goals and help them deliver what you want.</p><p>You only need to add a pinch of co-ordination and recognition!</p></div></article> </div></div></div></div><div class='col-md-12 text-center'> <h4 class='font-weight-semibold mb-2 pb-1 appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible'> Share this Post</h4></div><div class='share-buttons-container'> <div class='share-list'> <a class='fb-h' onclick='return fbs_click()' target='_blank' title='FACEBOOK'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/facebook-f.png'> </a> <a class='tw-h' onclick='return tbs_click()' target='_blank' title='TWITTER'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/twitter-squared.png'> </a> <a class='li-h' onclick='return lbs_click()' target='_blank' title='LINKEDIN'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/material-rounded/96/000000/linkedin.png'> </a> <a data-pin-do='buttonPin' data-pin-config='none' class='pi-h' onclick='return pbs_click()' target='_blank' title='PINTEREST'> <img src='https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/90/000000/pinterest.png'> </a> </div></div>",

It automatically streamlines workflow, collects and manages customer data (including personal and policy data), and can even send automatic alerts for policy renewals.

By adopting a customer-centric approach, insurance firms can leverage technology to engage customers and provide them with relevant insurance information. Insurtech empowers customers to access the insurance information that they need and relevant to them.</p></li><li><p><b>Minimizing frauds – </b>According to <a href='https://insurancefraud.org/fraud-stats/' rel='nofollow'>data</a>, <b>'Insurance fraud steals at least $308.6B every year from American consumers.'</b> That's devastating! Now, insurtech can assist MGAs and wholesalers in avoiding these events with data analytics and AI, as it can be used to identify and track patterns for suspicious behavior, analyze data points, and check customer data with other insurers for fraudulent activities.</p></li><li><p><b>Improving customer experience - </b>Brokers and agents want the same things the customer wants, such as less paperwork, more digitalization, access to information anywhere, etc. Insurance companies are transforming their operations as they emphasize technology. It helps develop personalized solutions, improving the organization's bottom line and enhancing the client's overall experience.</p></li><li><p><b>Optimizing operations - </b>For insurance providers, enhancing end-to-end operation is just as crucial as improving the client experience. Intelligent call center assistants and bots powered by AI, quick and accurate claim processing in the backend. These are just a few examples of an AI-focused strategy that can have a direct impact on MGAs, wholesalers and insurance provider's operations.</p></li></ul><h3 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Wrapping Up</h3> <p>To stay competitive in the insurance sector, it is necessary to utilize modernized technology such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analytics, predictive analytics, big data, the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud technology, and so on.

Insurance firms are associated with lots of paperwork, underwriting, filing claims, etc. All of these used to be long processes, but now things are changing, thanks to AI. It has several advantages, and one crucial example is streamlining the claims process. It shortens the time needed to settle claims. Furthermore, AI has the speed to evaluate enormous volumes of past claim data, which helps insurance companies comprehend client behavior and offer tailored solutions. Additionally, it also offers a deeper understanding of the market, which can be applied to improve the current products and increase sales.</p><p>Let us dive in deeper and explore how AI is influencing the insurance industry and the applications of AI in the insurance sector.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>How is AI used in the Insurance Industry</h2><p>These days, startups and technology driven insurance firms have begun to use AI in the insurance sector. AI has vast potential to help insurers grow their business. That is why the insurance sector must adopt the newest technologies, including blockchain, machine learning, robotic process automation, predictive analytics, and others, to stay competitive and meet market demands.</p><p><a href='<?=$baseurl2?>/blog/insurtech-trends-and-benefits'>Implementing the most recent technologies</a> can improve the time-consuming and laborious insurance process. There’s no second guessing that insurance firms can improve their current procedures with AI!  The integration of AI also helps in streamlining the underwriting process, detecting suspicious behavior and fraudulent activities. Overall, AI can perform tasks much faster than humans and with brilliant accuracy, and this makes room for enhanced efficiency.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>How is AI Transforming Traditional Insurance Practices</h2><p><b>Improving Claim Process</b></p><p>There was a time when the claim process was a hectic and demanding task. The claimant had to submit a written intimation to initiate the claim. After that, documents were taken for insurance claim processing, and the claim would be settled.</p><p>With AI assistance, insurance claims can be fast-tracked with minimum human intervention. Chatbots are one of the AI solutions that can facilitate customers initially and gather crucial information on the chat itself. Improving and simplifying processes is crucial, but ultimately, enhancing the customer experience is the most important outcome.</p><p><b>Customized Solutions</b></p><p>In the traditional insurance practice, one solution was provided to all customers. With the help of AI technology and predictive analytics, insurance companies can now better engage with their customers by analyzing and understanding large amounts of data.</p><p>Customer behavior and identifying trends enables them to provide personalized solutions according to clients' specific needs. It can be extremely helpful in improving customer engagement and the profit margin as well. It is one of the best examples of how AI is transforming insurance practices.</p><p><b>Eliminating Manual Processes</b></p><p>Automation AI is streamlining insurance processes, and it is also optimizing operational efficiency. Earlier, all these processes were manual and elaborate. In fact, most of these operations were repetitive tasks such as data entry, insurance document processing, etc. Undoubtedly, AI can free up valuable human resources and make the process a lot smoother, and that is exactly what it is doing. Insurance companies can now easily increase productivity and save money with better resource allocation, minimized manual errors, and workflow optimization.</p><p><b>Better Customer Service</b></p><p>In traditional insurance practice, customers were not met with prompt replies. As a result, they were disappointed with the service; it was one of the main reasons customers switched their insurers. Now, with conversational AI technology, customers are getting quick responses. Moreover, simple queries are handled by chatbots, saving time for the customer support team so they can invest their time in more complex questions that require human intervention.</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>What are the Top 5 Applications of Artificial Intelligence in the Insurance Sector</h2><ol><li><b>Fraud Detection</b></li><p>Over 7,000 businesses comprise the insurance sector, which annually collects over $1 trillion in premiums. The enormous size of the insurance sector creates more opportunities and incentives for engaging in illegal activity, significantly raising the cost of insurance fraud. According to data, it is estimated that the total cost of insurance fraud is more than $40 billion per year. That is why AI automation is a game changer for the insurance industry. It can give alerts, helping insurance firms identify people who can commit fraud. For this purpose, AI analyzes data, understands patterns, and looks for suspicious activity. That is how it helps insurance firms avoid fraudulent claims and save money.</p><li><b>Predictive Analytics</b></li><p>With the help of predictive analytics and AI, insurance companies can predict customer behavior, which enables insurance companies to customize their products. As a result, they are generating more revenue. AI examines data, detects patterns, forecasts trend, calculates claim probability, and provides personalized solutions to customers.</p><li><b>Automation</b></li><p>AI algorithms allow insurers to improve claims settlement processes, reducing manual intervention and increasing efficiency for policyholders. These algorithms can automate operations such as underwriting, data entry and other backend services. Automation helps insurers expedite the process by <a href='<?=$baseurl2?>/blog/how-data-management-benefits-the-insurance-agencies'>analyzing claim data and historical patterns</a>, providing a better customer experience.</p><li><b>Telematics</b></li><p>Now, the insurance industry is understanding the power of AI and the potential it has to improve insurance operations. Insurance companies are combining AI with telematics. It reveals more comprehensive driving risk insights than ever. Additionally, these insights can provide insurance companies with knowledge that enables precise, open insurance pricing. AI offers advantages to both parties as insurance companies understand the driving pattern of the driver and calculate premiums accordingly, meanwhile the accurate price of insurance is attractive to the customer.</p><li><b>Underwriting</b></li><p>The process of manual underwriting is time-consuming and prone to errors due to the need for precise assessment of risk variables. AI in the insurance underwriting process is enhancing the efficiency of insurance firms. It is one of the major applications of artificial intelligence in the insurance sector. With AI assistance, algorithms can prefill information, saving time in underwriting. Automating the underwriting process minimizes human error and processes applications quickly. Keeping underwriting modernized helps insurance organizations in customer retention, and as a result, clients are getting better service.</p></ol><h3 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'><b>AI Enhancing Customer Experience in the Insurance Industry</b></h3><p>Artificial Intelligence has invincible power, and one of the most common applications of AI is chatbots, analyzing bulk data and identifying patterns. Insurance companies can utilize AI to provide tailored solutions as per the needs of customers. A prompt reply can be given to customers by chatbots when they type any query over chat. Getting a fast response enhances customer experience.

Let’s stop you right there. It’ll all be worth it for your brand, and it’ll make for an amazing read!</p><p>Did you know that customer service tops the chart when it comes to being the main brand differentiator? That’s what 2024 looks like for e-commerce brands! Yes, it precedes product range and prices too. Unexpected? We’d say not really! Once our hunt for a product is over, the only thing customers want is a hassle-free purchase experience. They look forward to a simplified checkout, regular delivery updates, and availability of customer support (through live chat, on calls, or over email) if needed. While it may sound simple, managing these few aspects is trickier than managing most other tasks for e-commerce businesses. That is where stellar e-commerce customer support services come into the picture!</p><p>Let’s understand why: To manage seamless query resolution and ensure timely and to improve e-commerce customer service for your customers, the first thing you need is industry experts and communication experts; a team that knows about the purchase and the concerns of the customer and can help with the quickest and most satisfying resolution. There’s no negotiating the “team” here, since it absolutely isn’t a one-man job. Now, there are some questions that stand in the way – Do you really have the resources to put an entire team in place for customer support? Do you have such an elaborate hiring budget? Won’t that bite into a major chunk of your profit margin? If the answers are no, outsourcing customer support functions could be the key!</p><h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-dark'>Key Elements of Offering Great Customer Experience if you’re an E-commerce Brand</h2><p>By now, there’s no doubt that your biggest goal is to grow your e-commerce business and we have some idea that great customer experience in e-commerce hinges on several key elements. Firstly, seamless navigation is key to a good experience. Users should easily find products and information. Clear, concise product descriptions and high-quality images build trust and take the graph all the way to a successful purchase. A well-defined checkout process, with multiple payment options, makes the process a lot more convenient for a customer. For a quick example, we’ve seen how small merchants making room for cash for delivery operations spiked their sales in the last few years as opposed to those who would accept only prepayments. There’s so much difference that <a href='https://blog.hubspot.com/service/online-customer-retention' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>good customer service experience</a> can bring about!</p><ul><li>Most importantly, responsive customer support, through live chat or email, allows prompt issue resolution. So, this is something a brand cannot keep away from.</li><li>Wondering what more you can offer? Personalization by leveraging customer data can be a big shining light too!</li><li>Transparent policies on shipping, returns, and privacy build confidence and will earn you loyal customers.</li><li>Regular communication, such as order updates and newsletters, keeps customers engaged. </li><li>Lastly, valuing feedback creates a loop for continuous improvement, shaping a positive and enduring relationship between e-commerce brands and their customers.</li></ul><p>If these aren’t on your to-do list already, it’s time to put them on.

You stumble upon a website with sleek shoes that look great, but something's missing. No reviews, no size guides, no 'Flash sale, 50% OFF!' to convince you of this potential purchase. Suddenly, you're lost in a sea of shoes, unsure where to step next.</p><p>You now understand the plight of an unconverted e-commerce visitor! They're browsing, maybe even intrigued, but without a little nudge, it is very likely they'll run away to the next online store. That's where e-commerce lead generation comes in!</p><p>According to recent studies, 53% of marketers spend half of their budget on lead generation. Moreover, there’s no denying the truth that brands that prioritize e-commerce lead generation strategies witness a staggering increase in customer conversion rates. Successful e-commerce businesses attribute their success to a well-crafted lead generation strategy. More than 85% of companies consider lead generation as one of the most important goals of marketing. Wondering where do the challenges lie?</p><p>Here: according to the latest studies published by SEMrush and HubSpot, <b>61% of them see it as a great challenge to generate strong and reliable leads, as 79% of the leads generated are never converted into sales.</b> However, there’s no need to feel down in the dumps, because all you need is an effective strategy to sail right through.

Statistics reveal that the average online shopper spends a mere 15 seconds on a website. This time constraint emphasizes the need for swift lead capture strategies. Moreover, a lot of e-commerce customers expect personalized discounts or promotions, making it crucial for businesses to tailor their lead generation strategies accordingly. The dynamic nature of consumer behavior here makes e-commerce lead generation even more unique.

There’s a constant struggle to turn the curious browsers into loyal customers, and with so many competitors trying to do just that, what can you possibly do differently to hit the bull’s eye? How do you turn those casual visitors into high-quality leads, primed for conversion? We think you can make a big difference to e-commerce lead generation by revisiting your pre-sales process. Before the sales pitch and deal closing, there’s a vantage point teeming with opportunity for lead generation. So, leave behind the one-size-fits-all approach and take a fresh look at your pre-sales process with these 10 powerful strategies: </p><ol><li><b>Identify Your Potential Buyers (Realistically):</b> Don’t opt for the generic 'target audience.' You know your brand best, so you will also know the minds that it will create an impact in. <a href='https://www.ruleranalytics.com/blog/inbound-marketing/lead-generation-statistics/' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>91% of marketers say lead generation is the most important goal for their business.</a> Do some research, dig deeper, and find out who your ideal customer is. Start by understanding their online behavior, pain points, needs, wishes etc. What kind of content do you think would make them tick? By outlining your buyer persona, you will be able to personalize your pre-sales interactions exponentially. What would this mean?  Higher engagements and leads, instantly!</li><li><b>Go the Smart Way for Cold Calling:</b> Cold calls can still be very effective, but only if they are done right. Ditch the script and try to build curiosity in your buyers' minds. Get into it with a lot of research so that you know what they want and what you’re selling, and how you can marry the two perfectly!</li><li><b>Spend Time on Your Product Pages:</b> Building interactive product pages is a great idea. Moving away from static product descriptions and integrating product quizzes, size/fit recommendations, and interactive comparisons can be the way to go. This will help you bring in more visitors, shape a unique experience that they remember and come back for, and get valuable data like preferences and buying styles in your funnel, making lead qualification a cakewalk!</li><li><b>Always Put Out Social Proof:</b> No matter how out of style and repetitive they may seem, customer reviews, testimonials, and influencer endorsements help you establish the much-needed trust factor. You can also show user-generated content on product pages, in social media campaigns, and even pre-sales outreach emails. How and why does it always work? Seeing real people using and enjoying your products is often all it takes to convert potential leads into loyal customers.</li><li><b>Do Not Skip Constant Retargeting from your Pre-Sales Process:</b> Even though you’re a business, in some aspects of your life you’re a buyer too. Don the hat of the buyer to know that not all visitors are always ready to buy, but that doesn't mean they're lost. Gentle nudges through retargeting campaigns across social media and display networks can remind them of the products they viewed, guiding them back into your sales funnel.</li><li><b>Have Live Chat for Your Customers:</b> This one isn’t a must have if you’re just starting out or find it tedious, but having it makes everything so much better. 33% of marketers use live chat as a conversion tool! Don't leave your curious buyers waiting on their phone. Offer real-time assistance by having a live chat feature. Answer questions, offer recommendations, and make all the subtle efforts to convert them.</li><li><b>Never Give Up on Targeted Paid Ads:</b> If you think just pushing out some ads will do the trick, it won’t. You will have to identify your target audience and keep sliding the best of your brand their way. You can bring platforms like Google Ads and Facebook Ads to your rescue. These will help you reach your potential buyers based on interest, demographic, and online behavior. Using this outlined and well-researched approach will make sure your pre-sales efforts don’t go in vain and your ROI brings nothing but a smile.</li><li><b>Host Giveaways and Interactive Sessions: </b>We cannot stress this enough: Interact with your potential buyers every chance you get! Make things a little fun and spruce up some room for engaging contests, little giveaways, and stimulating quizzes. These could very well be related to your products or to your niche in general. Extend the scope of growth by pampering the winners with discounts or early bird access to the new launches that might be in queue. This will not only help you get the buzz going, but it will also help you build a database of interested customers.</li><li><b> The Right Partnerships Bring Mutual Growth:</b> Don’t shy away from collaborating with other brands or influencers that fall within your niche. You can indulge in several rewarding activities together like co-hosting webinars, creating joint promotions, or simply cross-promoting products. This is a great way to double your reach, gaining access to a new audience, and diversifying your current lead generation channels.<p>Talking about beneficial partnerships, if you think there’s too much on your plate and effective management seems miles away for your brand, partnering with a well-known <a href='<?=$baseurl2?>/e-commerce-outsourcing-services'target='_blank'>ecommerce outsourcing provider</a> can also work wonders! These tactics to boost e-commerce business always come in handy. </p></li><li><b>Make Room for Automation but Don’t Lose Human Touch: </b>Automating mundane tasks that are repetitive like sending email follow-ups or collecting lead data is a good idea. This not only frees up your time for customizing your outreach, but also provides high-touch support to your business. However, all businesses, whether big or small, must remember that automation is simply a tool to make things easier. You cannot use it as a replacement for human efforts and interaction on all fronts. You are the unique voice behind your brand, and that must live and shine!</li><p>Making these pre-sales strategies a part of your operational routine will help you transform not only your e-commerce website and brand presence, but also your growth chart. You’ll instantly go from being a passive store to a thriving business that knows the in-and-out of lead generation. You must keep in mind that the first step before you revamp any ongoing operations is understanding your audience, building a culture of offering value, and creating trust in the minds of your buyers throughout the pre-sales journey and even later. Ready to give it a head start, experiment, and see your lead count and conversion rates grow higher and higher?</p></ol><p><b>FBSPL Bonus Tip:</b> We recommend that you follow a simple three step process of <b>Tracking, Analyzing, and Revamping.</b> (Never forget that the pre-sales process is always an ongoing experiment, and you’ll have to keep reeling in newer ideas.) Start by tracking your campaign performance and get hold of the results. Use these metrics for analyzing your conversion rates, and revamp and fine-tune your strategies based on what you think works for your brand and what doesn't. Continuous optimization is the key, and it will help you keep your pre-sales lead generation efforts in check so that you always stay ahead of the curve. </p><div class='highlighted-paragraph mb-3'><h3 class='blog-defaulth55 text-dark'><p class='mb-0'><b>Interesting Read:</b> <a href='<?=$baseurl2?>/blog/business-scaling-and-growth' target='_blank'>What Is Scaling in Business & How Does It Differ from Growth?</a> </p></h3> </div><h3 class='blog-defaulth3 text-dark'>Before We Say it’s a Wrap </h3><p>Time to toss aside the dusty pre-sales playbook and tap into the ecommerce lead generation powerhouse.

Whatever you need support with, there are solutions to your challenge, always! You can seek a helping hand at every stage, especially for tasks that are repetitive and require a skilled workforce. Here‘s your eCommerce outsourcing guide to row you to brand success:<h3 class='text-dark blog-defaulth3'>Customer Support</h3><div class='highlighted-paragraph mb-3'><h3 class='text-dark blog-defaulth55'>“Customer service shouldn’t be a department; it should be the entire company” - <span style='font-weight: normal;'>Tony Hsieh, Zappos</span></h3></div><p>If you’ve been lagging when it comes to communicating with your customers, it’s time to check that off the list too. Effective customer support with multilingual teams providing email, chat, and phone support can help your business in more ways than you understand.<h3 class='text-dark blog-defaulth3'>Product Sourcing</h3><p>You can also find exceptional deals on product sourcing and procurement while managing logistics globally with the help of experienced sourcing partners. Lightening your burden on these fronts will only help you spend more time on brand strategy and other collaterals that matter.<h3 class='text-dark blog-defaulth3'>Order Fulfillment/Inventory Management</h3><p>You can outsource e-commerce order fulfillment and inventory management too. These overwhelming bits need not be yours to manage. Finding the right order processing, shipping, and inventory tracking partner will help you get so many needs in check!<h3 class='text-dark blog-defaulth3'>Website Management and Development</h3><p>It is always a good idea to let pros handle your online storefront, all the way from creation, design, and maintenance to SEO optimization and sales, outsourcing can come to your rescue on every front.<h3 class='text-dark blog-defaulth3'>Content Marketing</h3><p>Craft compelling product descriptions, blog posts, and social media content through skilled writers and marketers. The question to ask then is not how to outsource e-commerce customer service or why to outsource e-commerce customer service, but WHY NOT?<p>This is just a taste of the outsourcing feast. From graphic design to data analysis, the possibilities and e-commerce tasks to outsource are endless. So, embrace the power of delegation, savor efficiency, and watch your online business flourish!<h2 class='text-dark blog-defaulth2'>10 Outsourcing Best Practices for E-Commerce Businesses</h2><h3 class='text-dark blog-defaulth3'>1. Identify Your Needs and Set Clear Goals</h3><p>Start by understanding the areas where outsourcing would help you. Identify and list these specific areas, such as support with inventory management or improving customer service. Outsourcing these specific tasks to an organization that specializes in them will not only take the load off you, but it will also ensure better responsiveness from your end that will make room for more customer satisfaction.<h3 class='text-dark blog-defaulth3'>2. Make Room for Cultural Differences</h3><p>If it is your first time outsourcing certain tasks, you might have to embrace newness on several fronts. Before productivity seems to cleave in, you’ll have to build a rapport and trust with your outsourcing partner. It might be that your partner operates from some other corner of the world. While this may mean cultural differences, it isn’t a big challenge if you spend time understanding each other's patterns and strive towards the common and larger goal. Over time, you’ll start to see positive results that you could have entirely missed out on had you decided to dwell on these cultural differences.<h3 class='text-dark blog-defaulth3'>3. Reliable Communication Channels</h3><p>Create effective communication channels with your outsourcing partner. Make use of project management tools and engage in regular video meetings. This will not only keep you updated about timelines and executions in real time, but it will also help you understand the other team better and build a more meaningful and coordinated partnership over time.<h3 class='text-dark blog-defaulth3'>4. Comprehensive Data Security Measures</h3><p>Whatever else you leave behind, there is no missing out on this one. Make sure there are the right data security measures in place, and that these are multilayered too. Also, employ encryption protocols and sign confidentiality agreements. A good rule of thumb is to choose an outsourcing partner with ISO 27001 certification, so that you can ensure top-notch information security.<h3 class='text-dark blog-defaulth3'>5. Flexibility and Scalability Options</h3><p>When you have thought long and hard about having an outsourcing partner, make sure you do not wave the green flag at the wrong vendor. You never know when your e-commerce store could use a larger or a smaller workforce. So, it’s always wise to choose outsourcing partners that offer scalability options. For example, if your e-commerce business experiences seasonal spikes, a fulfillment center that can easily scale operations during peak times will be your best choice.<h3 class='text-dark blog-defaulth3'>6. Constant Performance Monitoring</h3><p>Continuous performance monitoring at your end is a responsibility that you simply cannot shrug off your shoulders. While finding a good e-commerce outsourcing partner will bring you the much-needed sigh of relief, you cannot get too dependent and keep away from doing the productivity and profits mathematics. Keep the reigns in your hands by utilizing analytics tools to track key performance indicators (KPIs). Outline your own specific KPIs and stay on top of general KPIs like:<ul><li>Project budget and expenditure<li>Timelines and percentage of accuracy in tasks<li>Response time and quality of service<li>Service level agreements (SLAs) met or not met</ul><h3 class='text-dark blog-defaulth3'>7. Ensure Adherence to Industry Regulations</h3><p>Check if your chosen outsourcing partner complies with industry regulations and standards. For instance, if operating in the e-commerce sector, an outsourcing partner will have to be well-versed with local and international consumer protection laws, DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act), Antitrust laws etc. Run a quick check on this front to make the right choice.<h3 class='text-dark blog-defaulth3'>8. Go for Cost-Effective Solutions Over Pocket-Friendly Solutions</h3><p>Don’t get too worked up about money and do not make it your very first consideration when you opt for outsourcing. While you must search and skim till you find the most cost-effective solutions, don’t opt for an outsourcing organization whose only unique selling point seems to be affordability. Remember, the cheapest is not always the best! (it seldom is). Optimize costs by choosing outsourcing solutions that offer the right value for money.<h3 class='text-dark blog-defaulth3'>9. Timely Performance Reviews and Feedback</h3><p>Keeping in touch and resolving hurdles as they come is the best way to keep pushing your business ahead. If you’re working with an outsourcing partner, resolve their queries and concerns and review their performance regularly. Conducting regular performance reviews and providing constructive feedback will help you with optimum solutions and timely delivery. This approach also shapes a conducive and collaborative environment.<h3 class='text-dark blog-defaulth3'>10. Choose the Right Outsourcing Provider</h3><p>It isn’t as much about what a vendor is providing as about what you really need. So, it isn’t just necessary to <a href='<?=$baseurl2?>/blog/why-should-you-opt-for-fbspl-as-your-business-process-outsourcing-partner'>find a reliable and organized outsourcer</a>, but one that can take care of all your needs. Outsource your e-commerce business needs to the provider that is the perfect fit in terms of understanding and providing solutions to your specific demands.<p>Successful e-commerce outsourcing cannot be achieved without a strategic approach, from defining objectives to continuous improvement through feedback loops. Each best practice contributes to a robust outsourcing strategy that enhances efficiency and ultimately benefits the overall success of the e-commerce business.<h3 class='text-dark blog-defaulth3'>In a Nutshell</h3><p>Adopting the best practices for e-commerce outsourcing is not just a strategy; in fact, it’s a necessity and a commitment to bettering your efficiency, scalability, and business success. Be it defining clear objectives or continuous performance monitoring, each practice helps you row your boat through the dynamic e-commerce landscape.<p>Successful outsourcing isn’t merely finding a service provider; it’s building a partnership that is in sync with your business goals.

We believe it is that tiny seed of an idea, which, with the fertile soil of strategic planning, the nourishing water of customer insights, and the gentle sunlight of personalized experiences, turns into a flourishing empire.</p> <p>But,</p> <p>Have you ever considered what happens when you keep all your E-commerce operations in-house?</p> <p><b>Here's a glimpse:</b></p> </div> <div class='ms-0 post-image pt-5 pb-5'><a><img src='<?=$baseurl?>/img/infographic_01.png' alt='In-house eCommerce Operation' class='img-fluid img-thumbnail img-thumbnail-no-borders rounded-0'></a></div> <p>Hence, in this blog, we invite you to embark on a comprehensive exploration, examining each aspect of E-commerce outsourcing that can propel your business. </p> <h2 class='text-dark blog-defaulth2 pt-5'>Let's See What You Stand to Gain When You Go for E-commerce Outsource Services in Operations and Fulfilment</h2> <p>Outsourcing operations and fulfillment unlock a world where tasks like order and payment processing, order tracking, return, refund, and exchange management, shipping inquiries, etc., become someone else's complexities, leaving you free to focus on what you do best. </p> <p>Want to know their approach?</p> <p><b>Here's the roadmap: </b></p> <li class='help-you-list my-3'><img class='p-2' src='<?=$baseurl?>/img/Leverages-Automation.png'> <h2 class='help-you-para-blog3 blog3_text text-dark text-left'>Leverages Automation</h2> </li> <p>When you go for E-commerce fulfillment outsourcing, your solutions provider does your warehouse management like never seen before. They ensure there is no more scrambling for the correct item or missed quality checks – just smooth, efficient fulfillment thanks to the wonders of robotics and automated storage and retrieval systems (ASRS). </p> <p>But they do not just stop here. They also throw in an order management system (OMS) that's basically the brains of your operation, which automates order processing, checks everything for quality at every step, and keeps you informed every inch of the way.</p> <p>So, with them,</p> <div class='container pb-3'> <div class='row card_border_Blog3'> <div class='col-md-12'> <div class='pt-3 pb-3 blog_div'> <h2 class='text-dark text_blog3 text-center'>You bid farewell to manual chaos and say hello to a streamlined, tech-powered fulfillment system!</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div> <li class='help-you-list my-3'><img class='p-2' src='<?=$baseurl?>/img/Optimizes-Inventory-Investment.png'> <h2 class='help-you-para-blog3 blog3_text text-dark text-left'>Optimizes Inventory Investment</h2> </li> <p>It will come as no surprise if we state that your outsourced E-commerce partner predicts stock demand like a crystal ball, ensuring you have just the right amount of inventory holding.</p> <p>Moreover, they ensure there is no overstocking and tying up of your cash. With just-in-time (JIT) inventory management, they also assist you with lowering stock-holding costs and lessening the risk of obsolescence.</p> <p>And with drop shipping, your suppliers efficiently handle all the storage and shipping. So that you can focus on selling and marketing, leaving the rest to the pros. </p> <div class='container pb-3'> <div class='row card_border_Blog3'> <div class='col-md-12'> <div class='pt-3 pb-3 blog_div'> <h2 class='text-dark text_blog3 text-center'>Sounds like freedom, doesn't it?</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div> <h2 class='blog-defaulth2 text-4 text-dark mt-2 pt-5 pb-3'> Well, With That in Mind, Let's Explore How E-commerce Outsourcing in Customer Experience and Support Benefits You </h2> <p>We know that customer experience isn't just about answering emails – it's a journey that involves customer review monitoring, pre-sales support, live chat, calls, and much more. From listening to online reviews and mapping out pain points to providing expert help before, during, and after a purchase, it's all about connecting with your customers at every touchpoint. </p> <p>But managing all that in-house can be a tedious task.</p> <p>Here's how your E-commerce outsourcing partner can benefit:</p> <li class='help-you-list my-3'><img class='p-2' src='<?=$baseurl?>/img/Addresses-Pain-Points-Proactively.png'> <h2 class='help-you-para-blog3 blog3_text text-dark text-left'>Addresses Pain Points Proactively</h2> </li> <p>Have you ever imagined glancing over your customers' shoulders as they run through your website or app?

That's why your outsourced E-commerce associate compares them to industry standards, like checking your score on the big test everyone takes. </p> <p>So, </p> <div class='container pb-3'> <div class='row card_border_Blog3'> <div class='col-md-12'> <div class='pt-3 pb-3 blog_div'> <h2 class='text-dark text_blog3 text-center'>They listen to your customers, track how they feel, and use that info to build a brand that shines! </h2> </div> </div> </div> </div> <li class='help-you-list my-3'><img class='p-2' src='<?=$baseurl?>/img/Accomplishes-Frictionless-Cancellation-Process.png'> <h2 class='help-you-para-blog3 blog3_text text-dark text-left'>Accomplishes Frictionless Cancellation Process</h2> </li> <p>Also, with E-commerce outsourcing services, you just drop the phone lines and paperwork, all thanks to natural language processing.

That's where exit interviews and win-back strategies come in - listen to why customers say 'see you soon' and use their feedback to improve things. </p> <p>So, think of it like this:</p> <div class='container pb-3'> <div class='row card_border_Blog3'> <div class='col-md-12'> <div class='pt-3 pb-3 blog_div'> <h2 class='text-dark text_blog3 text-center'>Your E-commerce ally leverages chatbots for quick fixes, exit interviews for healing, and win-back strategies for second chances!</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div> <li class='help-you-list my-3'><img class='p-2' src='<?=$baseurl?>/img/Secures-Contextual.png'> <h2 class='help-you-para-blog3 blog3_text text-dark text-left'>Secures Contextual and Comprehensive Customer Service</h2> </li> <p>That means, when you choose to hire out, you simply say no to technical jargon; you only think of service level agreements (SLAs) as promises your E-commerce companion makes to fix things within a certain timeframe.

Now, that price tag can make your shoppers hesitant and fill with so many ifs and buts.

Are They Necessary in Product Entry and Categorization?</h3> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p>We asked the same question to our content specialists, and they believe that reviews are the most underrated element in product descriptions but are equally powerful. To support their claim, they pointed out a study that indicated around <a href='https://www.brightlocal.com/research/local-consumer-review-survey/?SSAID=314743&SSCID=81k3_nrddv' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'> 78%</a> of online buyers trust reviews as much as any other personal recommendations. </p> <p>So, basically, social proof is a sign revealing to your buyers that you are trustworthy. They tell your customers that you are not the only one who thinks these products are worth spending money on.</p> <p>But by social proof, we do not mean only ratings but everything that your consumers appreciate about your product. Right from your product winning an award or getting featured in the press to your customers posting its pictures and telling people how satisfied they are with this purchase. </p> <p class='pb-3'>Now, the question arises: how do you use them in your product description?</p> <p><b>Here's an example to get you started: </b></p> <div class='ms-0 post-image pt-5'><a><img width='100%' src='<?=$baseurl?>/img/Furniture-Facebook-Cover-Banner.png' alt='How Ecommerce Product Description Helps You Choose a Modular Oasis Sofa' class='img-fluid img-thumbnail img-thumbnail-no-borders rounded-0'></a></div> <h3 class='text-dark blog-defaulth3 pt-5 text-center'>Want to know more?</h3> <div class='text-center'><a class='btn btn-modern btn-primary btn-outline btn-arrow-effect-1 btn-rounded text-5 mt-3 mb-3' href='https://www.fusionfirst.com/contact-fbspl' target='_blank'>Contact Us</a></div> <h3 class='text-dark blog-defaulth3 pt-5'>Is That All?</h3> <h3 class='text-dark blog-defaulth3 pt-0 pb-3'>Not Yet </h3> <h2 class='text-dark blog-defaulth2 pt-5'>Your Product Description Is Just Not About Humans - Robots Read Too </h2> <p>If you do not know already, you will be surprised to know that your product descriptions give you a great opportunity, or let's say they play a critical role in making your website rank higher on search engine results pages (SERPs). </p> <p>All you need to do is sprinkle some relevant keywords in your product descriptions. </p> <p>So, keywords are the words your potential buyers type in the Google search bar when shopping online. They are also the words that act as flags that help search engines understand what your content or page is all about. </p> <p>Hence, next time when you write any product description, try using keywords. Now, what kind of keywords should you use? </p> <p>We recommend long-tail keywords for two reasons: </p> <p>One, they have lower competition, giving you better chances of ranking higher in SERPs.</p> <p>Second, they are super specific in nature and get searched by only serious buyers. For example, a long-tail keyword like waterproof hiking boots for women with wide calves will only be searched by those customers who are in the final stage of their search or have fully made up their minds about the product they want. This brings more conversion rates. </p> <p>But in no case should you force keywords.
