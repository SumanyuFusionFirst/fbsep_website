My name is Edward Parmas and I'm gonna be your host. Introducing your ongoing and further host, Mr. Kb. How are you doing today, sir? Hey, Edward. I'm fantastic. How are you? Great, great, great, great. So today's episode is all about introducing the world to kb, introducing people to the podcast and to the wonderful company that is FBS P, and all the things that they do. So to kind of backtrack here, what was your career path that led you to <b>fbspl</b></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Oh, uh, good one. So I have to trail back to the [00:01:00] memories now. Uh, so yeah, I, I think I started my career very early on when, you know, I was still studying and, uh, doing my graduation and outsourcing war. And I believe it still is the only industry that is, you know, welcoming Freshers wide arms. And, uh, so it was an obvious choice for me. So I started my job back then, and I became part of the industry. I was getting international exposure, which was great back then, you know, uh, back in two thousands, early two thousands, and I was helping individuals. I was, I was helping businesses, and I, I loved what I was doing. and, uh, I, I got associated with, uh, fusion or FBSPL back in 2007. It has been a great journey so far. Uh, here at Fbspl. I, I love the culture we have as a company. I mean, you have an idea, you share it, you implement it, and you take it ahead and, and that's empowering. That, that's [00:02:00] very satisfactory as an employee. It gives you a feeling of accomplishment. You know, when you see your ideas turning into reality.</div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Edward Purmalis:</b> Very nice. 16 years at the company. That is definitely a milestone. Something that you don't see a lot of nowadays with people job hopping all over the place and uh, hey, I'm in exactly the same boat, uh, I. Also straight out of high school. Started working for outsourced companies out of here in my little part of Europe, uh, working on different American projects. Uh, so, uh, yeah, sim similar backgrounds right there, . So, uh, you, you joined us, like you joined them within a couple first couple of years of Fbspl being founded.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Uh, yes. So it was 2006, uh, when the company wa founded. I, I joined, uh, in 2006. Then, as I said, I was, you know, studying, uh, I took a break for my studies. I, I joined back in 2000 and. Eight [00:03:00] again, because I was into my master's that time. I was doing my Master's of Business Administration and during the examination I left the job because I needed some time to study as well. Uh, but yes, then I, I came back in 2010 and since then I'm continuously working with them.</div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Edward Purmalis:</b> Very nice. So how large was the team when you joined in 2007. And how big is it?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> So that time I still remember it was a small room and, uh, we were a team of about five or 10 members at most. Uh, uh, uh, I, I'm still connected with all of them.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Uh, I know some of them are still working with me. So that was back then and today we stand up, you know, with a team of about, uh, 600 members plus, minus ten.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Edward Purmalis:</b> Very, very, very nice. Uh, and going back to that time in 2006, 2007, what was kind of the reason why F B S P L was founded? Who were you trying to [00:04:00] help and what was the business idea that got this all off the ground?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Right. So, uh, the owner of F P S P L and the managing director, Mr. Madhukar Dubey, he is an IT enthusiast and back in early two thousands, the opportunities in the domestic region were so few. So he had this vision to be the biggest employer in the area, so providing a portion to the bright talent in the community. And the idea was also to help other businesses with a opportunity to grow.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Affordable rates and hence FBSPL came into existence and, uh, up to its name, you know, the fusion. We are fusion of, uh, different ethnicities, different backgrounds, and different skill sets. So that's how it all begin in here we are today.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Edward Purmalis:</b> Awesome. So from a 10 person office to over 600 strong, now you're at a spot [00:05:00] where you are starting a podcast, serving the insurance industry, making sure that their business operations are being properly done, allowing them to scale.So why should the insurance professional of 2023 tune into this podcast?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Well, good one. So insurance is one of the biggest industries worldwide, and it's growing every day. Uh, yet there are so few resources are labeled, uh, for the industry experience to gain knowledge and insights. So this is a step towards creating a place where we are not only helping our clients, but building a knowledge pool and a resource for everyone in the in the industry. This is also for insurance businesses that would like to learn about transformation, optimizing processes, cost reduction, technology, insurance, and improving customer services. Uh, you know, so those who will be benefited a lot.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Edward Purmalis:</b> Very nice. And when you look at the [00:06:00] kind of insurance business as it operates today, where do you see some flaws? What are companies doing wrong? Where are they dropping the ball in their business operations as it relates to the insurance sector?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> So some of it has to do with the legacy systems, uh, they still have to follow. So there are legacy systems, uh, there are repetitive mundane processes. Uh, very few in the industry are exploring innovative ways to transform.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>and efficient adoption of technology is too low within the insurance domain, uh, which leads to poor data management. Uh, uh, one example, let's say inefficient claims processing. So insurance companies may struggle with slow and complex claims processing, leading to a long wait times and frustration for policy holders and, you know, All related, outdated, outdated systems and processes, lack of cost control, inadequate training and development for employees.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>So this all leads to demotivation among the [00:07:00] members of the, the, the industry. It makes their jobs harder and at the same time, their clients are not happy to. So I think these are few of the top challenges insurance industry is looking into right now.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Edward Purmalis:</b> So there's not. Technological transformation going on, right? It's a bit of a stagnation, and I can, I can relate to that. I've moved between, you know, jobs before I went from, you know, selling for a enterprise level travel agency to working in a small recruiting company, and I went from a, you know, in-house built like robust CRM. To a legacy database where, you know, it was, it, it, it automatically just kills your productivity and especially now that like the job market is becoming so flush with all this amazing talent coming out of the tech sector, uh, with all the layoffs, uh, you know, especially for revenue teams like salespeople are very likely to go try something new like selling insurance. And I believe that without those technological implica, with, without those technological advancements, it's gonna be very hard to. [00:08:00] You know, these SaaS superstars stay in an environment where they have to do all this manual work.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Exactly. So this, this, this has becoming a problem, and as you rightly said, you know, the hiring is becoming a challenge because the, the new generation, they're so technologically advanced, they don't want to do this paperwork over and over and again.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>And that becomes a problem for the companies where we, they still have to maintain the regards that data. It should always be updated for compliance reasons, for record basis, and for what not. I, I give an example. There is a client, you know, they, they are a team of about 2000 members. They have a tool in place, but they're not utilizing it properly.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>So when, when the. The, the adoption of technology is not there. The customer and the company, they're going to suffer a lot. So they reached out to us. They wanted help to, you know, optimize the use of their tools. Uh, they have in place. We help them [00:09:00] out. It's working fantastic right now. But yes, uh, this is, uh, uh, one of the biggest challenge, uh, that the industry is looking.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Edward Purmalis:</b> And what about like, the kind of software model that goes into insurance? Like have there been a lot of technological advancements in that, uh, in that sphere? Is there a lot of like, you know, kind of cutthroat to, you know, technology software coming out for the insurance sector? And is it just that companies aren't, uh, getting to it or is it that there's also a stagnation in the kind of creation and uh, uh, development process of new tech for, uh, that's specifically for insurance as a whole?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> So I would say the advancement is there, but it's not, you know, uh, at the same basis as it's happening in other domains. Uh, but yes, it's, it's there. It has started, but you know, the ones who are early adopters will be the winners ultimately, and the ones who are not adopting the technology. or thinking about the transformation about [00:10:00] their processes and how to merge technology in their processes. They would be, you know, have a difficult time in, in, in longer run. Uh, but yes, technology's coming in. I, I give you an example. There is, there is a client of ours he has built, uh, An AI based platform that helps you in hope inspection. So what you, you know, earlier there were inspectors going to, to the house doing the inspection, and then there was lots of cycle that was followed after that.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>But with the, this technology, you just have to point your phone, you know, towards your house and, and, and it gives you automatic . Inspection report. So you know, as I said, technology is coming in, but it's slow and the early adopters will get the most benefit.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Edward Purmalis:</b> I'm gonna throw a curve ball at you here. So, uh, if you have to look at, let's just say some software companies that are currently serving insurance that you would recommend, what would you say is, let's just [00:11:00] say legacy software versus something newer.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Can you name, can you give us some names? Like, for example, you know, I don't know, Salesforce to HubSpot or, you know, what, what you would recommend that, uh, your listeners would look into as potentially their next upgrade.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> So I would say, you know, uh, so I, I, I talk about, uh, let's say agency level first because, uh, they, otherwise, the bigger giants in the industry, they have their own proprietary tools in place.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>But let's talk about the agency level. So, I won't say there is new technology that can be, you know, phenomenal in years to come. But yes, there are already tools that are, you know, being modified every day. Uh, and the agencies are using them as well, but not to their optimal level. So, for example, there is called Applied Epic, which is an agency management system.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>There is hawksoft. AMS 360, there is QQ Catalyst. So these are few widely used agency management [00:12:00] systems. Uh, however, again, you know, not every agency is utilizing them as efficiently as they should be.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Edward Purmalis:</b> Oh, okay. So it's not about buying new tech, it's about making the tech that you already have work and making it, uh, integrating it better into your everyday process.newer.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Okay. Uh, looks like I learned something new. . Uh, alright. So when, when it comes to this podcast, like, who, who is the persona? Who is the who, who is the individual at, uh, at, at an insurance company that should really tune in? Listen, who would get the most value out of what's to come with this, uh, season of the show?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Oh, uh, I think everyone in the industry, the businesses and the professionals involved in the industry, right? From a producer to an account manager to a customer support representative. Nope. Uh, the underwriters, I think it, it, it's meant for everyone who are in the, in the industry and working, you know, uh, towards client facing things on the [00:13:00] paperwork, because as I said, you know, there are not, not many resources out there where they can go to for, for the enhancement of their knowledge and, and, and to see what's, what's out there.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>What, what's latest out there when they seek help, they usually go to a consultant. Which, which, which? Always a paid option. So we wanted to make sure that there, there is something for everyone and if they have, you know, they have some questions, they need some knowledge, they need some insight. They have a place where they can go to.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Edward Purmalis:</b> All right, so everybody, insurance in insurance should look out and start listening. And for those who start listening, what kind of content can they expect? Is it gonna be just interviews? Is it gonna be more like, uh, fireside chats? What can people expect from this podcast?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Um, I'm glad you asked this. So, uh, you know, we are early on in this one. We are still, uh, you know, Uh, uh, modifying it. But, uh, you know, so far what we haven't [00:14:00] planned is like ideas to optimize the operational processes, how to bring innovation in the business, optimum use of technology, resources to cost. Again, because cost is, is one of the biggest challenge. For the industry, uh, then there will be thought provoking insights on industry trends and challenges, experts analysis on risk, and how they can be managed while in fact, case studies showcasing innovative solutions in best practices.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Interviews, as you rightly said, so interviews with industry leaders and influencers, discussions on technology and digital transformation in insurance, uh, tips and advice for risk management and underwriting. Regulatory updates and its impact on the industry and maybe stories on evolving customer needs and expectations.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Edward Purmalis:</b> So there is truly a lot to cover. Amazing. Awesome. Well, thank you for tuning in everybody. This is the first and last time you're hearing from me. As of next episode, KB’s [00:15:00] running the show.

This remarkable individual has been with FBSPL for over a decade and has risen through the ranks to become the head of operations leading a team of 500 members. His leadership skills have earned him the admiration of both his team members and clients who value his expertise, dedication, and unwavering commitment to excellence. But that's not all. Our guest is also a devoted father of twin girls, and when he's not leading his team to success, he can be found indulging in his guilty pleasure of binge watching his favorite shows on Netflix. When he travels, he prefers serene and peaceful locations. But don't let that fool you. He's no monk. He knows..he knows how to let loose and party with the best of them. In fact, he's the life of the party and the last one standing on the dance floor. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm your host KB on the podcast called Business Transformation with FBSPL-Insurance Edition. And it is an honor to have such an accomplished and charismatic individual on our podcast. Our guests will share with us his inspiring journey of hard work, perseverance, and leadership, as well as his insights into how FBSPL brings transformation to the businesses that it works with. So, sit back, relax, and prepare to be inspired. Shekhar, I welcome you on this episode of the podcast. How are you?</div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Shekhar Dhabhai:</b> Thanks. Thanks KB. And this was really a nice introduction I, someone had, could have given to me, so thank, thank you so much. I'm doing fantastic. How are you doing today?</div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> I'm doing great and, and I, I'm so excited about this episode of the podcast. Uh, this is our first episode in a way and, uh, I'm so pleased that you know someone who is my friend who has been working with me since a long time is my guest of the show tonight. So I'm, I'm I, I'm sure we are going to have lots of fun today.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Shekhar Dhabhai:</b> Likewise.</div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar</b>: Perfect. So let's start it, you know, for our audience. Uh, can you describe your role and responsibilities with FBSPL?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Shekhar Dhabhai:</b> Sure. So, uh, like in FBSPL right now I'm working as an Assistant General Manager-Operations. So, I'm responsible for the day-to-day operations of the company, including the delivery of the services to the clients, ensuring all the processes are running smoothly and efficiently, uh, developing and implementing the process improvements, managing and mentoring team members. To ensure that they are meeting the performance targets, developing their skills, knowledge, and delivering high quality services to the client. Yeah. And of course, ensuring quality control also. So, I'm overall, like I'm responsible for managing and improving the operations, business operations to deliver high quality services to the client and drive the growth of the company.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> And mind you, everyone, he might not be speaking high of himself, but he's doing a phenomenal job. And I'm personally observing his performance, you know, from last decade. And, uh, I have seen him taking up shape as a professional. Uh, he is today, and he's admired, as I said earlier. A like by his team members and both clients. So, uh, yeah, you have been doing a great job. Thanks for being part of the journey so far. Uh, cool. So, before FBSPL, what was the most unexpected career you have had?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Shekhar Dhabhai:</b> Wow. That's a, that's a nice question. So, like, before joining FBSPL, um, I worked in HDFC bank as a senior account executive, and that was back in 2008 or nine. Uh, I wouldn't say unexpected because after like completing my master's degree in business administration and that too in the finance as a, as a major, uh, I got my first opportunity to, which I could not deny. However, like after working for a year, I realized that it's not a cup of my tea because my interest was more into the computers and at the time, uh, the, IT and the bpo, um, services in India began to accelerate rapidly. Right. So, I decided to switch.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> So that was about 2008, right?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Fantastic. You know, I have had kind of similar thing. So after my short stint with the, the business process management, um, you know, while my studies, I also joined, you know, after my master's, a banking, uh, corporation, and I was, uh, a team lead in, uh, a corporate card or to be really specific patrol car division and to my amusement. The petrol card machines were not even installed in the petrol stations at that time. And I was trying to sell that and I was like, where am I? What am I doing with my life? And I was like, let's go back to business process management and business process outsourcing. And I'm loving it so far. Fantastic.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Shekhar Dhabhai:</b> Absolutely. Absolutely. And, and to add to this, uh, one more thing, um, like I respect my first job. The reason behind this is because that was my first job and, and that too into a bank. So that was a corporate. So, I was more inclined. Now, I learned things, how to work in a corporate, and this helps me a lot now.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Fantastic. Cool. So if you had to describe yourself in just three words, what would they be?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Shekhar Dhabhai:</b> Three words. So, if I talk professionally, I am experienced, accomplished, and innovative. However, if I talk personally, I am amiable, of course, fun loving and spiritual.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> And let me tell you, everyone he amiable but what, when it takes, when it requires, he can be one of the biggest driver as well, so don't let that fool you. Alright. Uh, and uh, still talking about the fun side of things. Uh, what are the first three apps or mobile applications that you open on your phone in the morning?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Shekhar Dhabhai:</b> Yeah, usually I, when I, when I wake up, I, I jump on first on my cell phone to see what's happening. But after the guidance from our owner, Madhukar sir, he told that the first thing, you don't have to check the mobile when you wake up. So now I'm following this practice. I do not see my phone in the morning when I wake up. I'll, however, like after two to three hours, I usually check Microsoft Teams, WhatsApp and Instagram, of course.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Wow. Cool. And what's your favorite hobby or pastime outside of your work? Of course.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Shekhar Dhabhai:</b> Oh, so as you, as you already mentioned, like I love to watch Netflix web series is, um, I, I'm a binge watcher usually when I am alone during, uh, during, during the weekends and especially during the night hours. So I love to watch Netflix, or I go to the places where I find peace. Peace of mind. Right. And uh, when I, when I'm with my family, then I spend most of my time with my daughters. Both are nine years old now.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Wow. Wow. So, which was the last web series you watched?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Shekhar Dhabhai:</b> So right now, I'm watching Father and I'm, I'm on the fifth season.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Oh, wow. You, you really are a binge watcher. Okay. Uh, so hypothetically, just imagine if you could have dinner with any historical figure. Who would it be and why?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Shekhar Dhabhai:</b> I would love to answer this question because my role model is Mahendra Singh Dhoni if you, if you remember, he's one of the most successful Indian cricket, captains in the history of Indian cricket. Right. So having dinner with Mahendra Singh Dhoni would be an opportunity for me to learn about his leadership style, like, um, his approach to building and leading successful teams. His calmness under pressure and his ability to motivate and inspire his teammates could provide valuable insight into his leadership style and how to build a winning team culture.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Wow. That sounds fantastic. Even I would like to join that. Alright, let's discuss something, uh, about business as we are talking about business transformation with FBSPL. So, what are some key trends driving business transformation in the insurance industry today? And how is FBSPL positioning itself to take advantage of these trends?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Shekhar Dhabhai:</b> Sure. So, like the, the top three trends, what we have observed, or I have personally observed in the US industry. First it's digitalization and automation, which is now evolving. So, with the, like with qualification of digital technologies and rise in the automation, insurers are now leveraging tools and platforms to streamline their operations. They improve efficiency and enhance their customer experience. So, for example, like, um, if I talk about digital technologies, they are being used to automate underwriting, claims processing, and customer service also, uh, while also enabling insurance to offer new products and services. The second trend, uh, which is evolving, is like data and analytics, and the third is customer centricity. So, companies are now increasingly focusing on improving the customer experience by tailoring their products and services to meet the needs of the preferences of the individual customers. So overall, these trends are driving, uh, significant transformation in the US industry, uh, with insurers like seeking to innovate and adapt, uh, the competition or the competitive market to meet the evolving needs of their customers. We are investing a lot in learning and development of new technology and insurance agencies software so that we can provide the best service at a competitive cost. So, our team are now proficient in operating most of the agency management systems such as like<b> Applied Epic, AMS 360, HawkSoft, Easy Links, insured Mind Agency blog,</b> their n number, and many more. Right? So, we are also like fine tuning our team to assist uh, US insurance agencies in process improvements through their artificial intelligence and applying lean methodology to their existing and, uh, their traditional insurance processes.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Wow. Lean Sounds lean, but still heavy, you know, , . Cool. Uh, and what role does innovation play in the insurance industry? How do you foster a culture of innovation within FBSL because you said, you know, the, the technology and the changes or the use of AI and all that stuff. So there's lots of innovation everywhere. And I'm sure there must be some sort of innovation within the insurance industry as well. So how do you make sure that you have a culture adapting and continuously innovating things, processes within your, uh, you know, organization and teams?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Shekhar Dhabhai:</b> Sure. So like, um, innovation is really critical to the success of any industry, not especially for insurance, for any industry, innovation is really critical, and with the rise of new technologies, changing customer expectations and evolving market dynamics, uh, insurers must continually innovate to remain competitive and meet the needs of their customers. At Fusion Business Solutions, like what we do is like we foster a culture of innovation by encouraging our team to explore new ideas and push the boundaries of what is possible in business process management and, andAT of course. So, we provide them with the resources, support, and freedom they need to pursue innovative research projects that have the potential to transform the industry.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Wow. And this last aspect, you added the, the freedom of thoughts. Yes. That's very important. And I, being part of the FBS P can double on that because I know, you know, you do not have that liberty, uh, within the corporate world, not everywhere. But yes, at FBSPL you, you have that freedom where you have an idea, you are suggesting that you are making sure that it's getting implemented and you are being part of something new and something innovative that's going to happen or change or transform the ways everyone is working. So that's, that's, you know, that's very liberating and, and something great. Uh, and, and I feel proud to be part of such an organization. Absolutely. And I'm sure you absolutely feel the same.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Shekhar Dhabhai:</b> Yes. And this is a necessity now it is required if we'll not free our team members to think out of the box, they will be bound to a certain limit only.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Right. So, we have talked about transformation and innovation in. You know, I, I give you an example. Well, I, I am for one, uh, you know, being part of the sales and marketing team, I love technology and how it can simplify my work processes in my outreach programs. So, I keep on looking for new technology and I keep on suggesting it to my teams. But then I realized I'm, I'm sharing new things and new technologies, you know, too frequently, and my team members might feel that the consistency is not there. So how do you balance the need for innovation and transformation? What's the need to maintain stability and consistency for your customers?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Shekhar Dhabhai:</b> Well, I was expecting that question. Absolutely. So, like in in Fusion Business Solutions, what we usually do is like we believe in innovation and stability, of course, and not mutually exclusive. So, we work with our clients in the insurance industry to provide innovative solutions that meet their needs while maintaining stability and consistency of their processes. So, by fostering a culture of innovation, we aim to help our clients explore new opportunities while we take care of and prioritize their needs and expectations.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Okay. Okay, cool. And how do you encourage continuous learning and growth among your employees? And what role does leadership play in this process?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Shekhar Dhabhai:</b> Yes. So, we offer like, um, training and development programs that provide our employees with the skills and knowledge they need to success in their roles and advance their careers. Right. We encourage our employees to pursue new. Opportunities that share their knowledge and expertise with others. We offer opportunities for career growth and advancements. That includes mentorship, coaching, leadership, development programs and et cetera. And we also support, um, employee-led initiatives. So, example like a research project and <b>community out ship program.</b>So that helps our employees build new skills and develop leadership capabilities.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Alright, so you talked about a couple of things that you as an organization are doing for the team members. How do you measure the impact of your training and development programs? And what kind of matrices do you use to assist their effectiveness?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Shekhar Dhabhai:</b> So, we have our systems in place already. We regularly survey, um, employees who participate in our training development programs to gather feedbacks on the program's content, delivery and effectiveness. We use their feedback to make improvements and, um, iterate on our programs. Right? We measure learning outcomes such as like knowledge gain or skill develop to assess the impact of the programs on employee growth and development. We also, um, measure the business impact on our programs, such as like changes in productivity of employee retention rates to understand the broader impact of our programs in our organization. We track participations and completion rates of, uh, to understand how engaged employees are in our programs and to identify areas where you need to improve engagement. And of course, the ROI is there. So, we also measure the return of investment of our programs by comparing the cost of the program to the business impact it generates.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Right. I, I always, uh, remember this one line from our managing director, Mr. Madhukar Dubey, that, uh, ‘no matter if a person is leaving an organization, but when he leaves, he should be a better person. He should be more skill, and he should be readily employable’. And I have seen that happening. You know, uh, the organizations jump on the employees getting out of FBSPL if they, if they are joining somewhere else. So I can relate to that. Uh, cool. Now we have talked about business transformation. We have talked a bit about the training side of things. Now a very important aspect of the business, the clients. So how do you define a happy client? Because I know the happiness is one of the, uh, values that FBSPL believes in. And then there's another value that's called clients first. And then, uh, the tagline, keeping you first. So how do you define a happy client and how do you measure the client happiness?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Shekhar Dhabhai:</b> Yes. So, the, global definition of a happy client, we define as a happy client as one who is satisfied with the quality of the service, that feels their needs are being met and has positive experience working with us. So happy clients are more likely to continue working with us, recommend our services to others, and provide positive feedbacks. And how we measure is, of course the first one is the net promoter score, which is a widely used metrics that used right, that, um, the clients are recommending our products and services to others. So we survey clients after they have worked with us to gather the feedback on their experience and calculate our nps score based on their responses. Second, um, method is through customer satisfaction surveys. Uh, and then that is through Clutch we are currently using. So we also, um, regularly conduct customer surveys, uh, surveys to gather feedback on the quantity and the quality of service we provide. And then the client retention rate is one of the aspects.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Amazing. And, uh, just to add to it, because I'm part of the marketing and sales side of things. So, uh, to date, uh, the biggest source of getting new clients is still referrals from the existing client and which speaks volumes about the delivery. that you as an operation team are delivering to your clients. And that gives us an idea that yes, our clients are happy. So thank you so much for that. You're making our lives easier. Uh, you know, uh, otherwise sales is a tough job and tough place to be. All right. Uh, let’s towards the end, take things on the fund side again. Uh, you know, we talked about who would you like to dine if you have to, just imagination. So we are talking about the Insurance Edition, the business transformation and insurance, and to add a little fun element to it, if you could ensure any historical event, what would it be and why?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Shekhar Dhabhai:</b> Historical event. Yeah. Okay. All right. So let me think a bit. So, if that was possible, um, I suggest to insure the Jallianwala Bagh massacre that occurred in 1919 in the city of Amritsar, in Punjab. Right. Um, that resulted in the deaths of hundred of people and injuring many more. So the insurance policy could have covered a range of risks such as like medical expenses, property image, and loss of life among others.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Very nice, sir. And, uh, my last request, brief message for our listeners, please.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Shekhar Dhabhai:</b> Absolutely.

Welcome to our podcast Transformation with FBSPL Insurance Edition. Welcome to our podcast and, uh, this episode, we are thrilled to have Chin as our guest today as the founder and president of. CHRP Chin has over 18 years of experience in the insurance industry. During the past decade, he has played a pivotal role in spearheading large scale digital and AI transformations for some of the industry's major players at Deloitte Digital.

He enjoys spending time outdoors, playing on hikes and taking in the national beauty around him. Chin is also a big foodie and loves trying new restaurants and cuisines. We are excited to learn more about Chin's insights and experiences in the insurance industry and explore his diverse set of interests. Let's get started. Hi Chin. How are you?</div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Chin Ma:</b>I'm good, KB. How are you doing, man?</div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Doing fantastic. Doing fantastic. It's a sunny day. We are meeting an episode. I'm all excited and here.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Chin Ma:</b> I can't agree more. I think you and I both are in the northeast or semi northeast, near New York City in the tri-state area. So, uh, finally I think, uh, a little bit of spring is rearing its head.</div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Oh. Yeah.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Chin Ma:</b> Always enjoy that.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Fantastic. So, let's start. Uh, so what inspired you to create CHRP technologies and what does the company do.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Chin Ma:</b> Maybe I'll start with the second part first. Um, CHRP is an AI-enabled loss prevention platform. Um, it focuses on insurance companies, specifically home insurance companies. Um, and what we do is we conduct home inspections on behalf of home insurance companies, uh, utilize AI to analyze those inspections with the intent to achieve two things. Uh, one is to help home insurance companies reduce losses, which in effect, in insurance terms are claims, um, but also to help people, uh, maintain healthy homes. Um, if you think about all the important things in your life, your health, uh, your major assets like your car, we as Americans, you know, go to the dentist twice a year.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>get an annual physical, uh, get a car checkup every year because we're required to do so. But, um, for the asset that is our home, um, which is likely the most expensive asset that anyone owns, uh, we don't do regular checkups of that home, right? And so, we believe that with better insight into things that can disrupt your life, like uh, plumbing in your bathroom, that may go bust and cause you not to be able to use it and helping people with that problem and fix it. Those are the kinds of things that we believe we do, uh, which helps to provide people with a health checkup for their home. Um, and more importantly, fix the things that co go bump in the night. Um, when it comes to why, you know, we decided to start the company about two years ago. Um, that was the hallmark of, of what excited us so much about the business idea. Um, we saw an immense. In the home insurance industry, meaning not a lot of home insurance companies deliberately utilize inspections to be able to identify things that could go wrong. Uh, they then don't necessarily prevent those claims from happening. Um, and when we launched the business, you know, we thought that, boy, if it was just for home insurance companies to save money, it would be a pretty poor way to go about. We all know you as home insurance buyers, or for those of you that do have homes that have bought insurance, your relationship with your insurance company isn't that great. Um, there's a lot of wonderful commercials and marketing about the relationship with the insurance companies, but not a lot of them other than engaging you. When you buy the insurance, when you renew the insurance, or when you're filing a claim, it delivers a wonderful experience. And so, our question was really how could we intersect with insurance companies to help people better understand what's going on in their home and help them maintain healthy homes? Um, and once we kind of realized that wow, we could save insurance companies a ton of money, but more [00:05:00] importantly we can help people better know and understand what's going on in their home, um, we realized that we. And all it took was for us to decide to go and build the business, to quit our jobs and all those wonderful things that I'm sure other entrepreneurs like me had to go through. Um, but that's what excited us most about the business and that's what caused us to start it.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Wow. Amazing. Amazing. And, uh, I'm, I'm sure you, you might have, uh, with none of this, but what step apart from the other tech companies in the market?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Chin Ma:</b> Good question. Um, words like low-code, no-code ai, whether if it's generative AI or chat e p t, um, or cloud or digital native or what have you, are all really important buzzwords that I'm sure many of the listeners of this podcast have heard over the course of the last 10 20. Um, I think when you look at it, a lot of companies take those problems, um, or, or take those words and they say, wow, this is a really wonderful hammer that we can use to hammer any kind of nail that we can't. Um, I think not a lot of it, I think not a lot of technology companies. Actually, solve for the nails first. I'll give you an example, right? We never, when we started, we never sought technology first. Technology was more of a solution to a problem. Um, we actually worked to identify the problems and proved that if we solved those problems, it would. A meaningful impact to achieve the objectives that I just mentioned, right? How do we help insurance companies, uh, prevent claims and thus save a ton of money? And how do we help homeowners better understand their homes so they can maintain healthy homes? Um, and so we worked really hard putting together an MVP that was non-technology oriented to be able to drive all of our use cases. That was meaningful to home insurance companies today in 2017. And through that experience, our aha moment around the technology side came in 2020. Uh, we realized that utilization of computer vision was the perfect chassis or computer vision. AI was the perfect chassis, uh, to be able to solve these problems at scale. And so, if I boil it down, what makes us different. Um, we solved for the nails first and then we found the right hammer, right, to solve it.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> That's, that's a fantastic analogy. Nail and hammer. And I see a lot of tech companies these days, they come up with a product first and then they try to identify a problem to solve with that. And that's why most of those startups failed. So, I, I, I'm, I'm glad you are already on the right path to success.</div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Chin Ma:</b> Yeah. I, I, you know, I agree. Right. And I think, you know, you see indications of that a lot in the industry. You know, wow. We have a low-code, no-code platform that can do anything. Right, right. Imagine what AI could do for your business. Um, imagine if you just applied automation to, you know, processes, period. Right., a lot of tech companies approach that problem with, okay, so, you know, tell us what you want us to do with that. Those are the nails, right? And so, the disconnect between technology such as the hammer and problems with the nails oftentimes is completely unhinged. Meaning, you know, you look at that problem. Why are you the technology company not helping me solve my nails? You should come to me with, hey, I got a great solution to solve all of these prospective problems, and I know exactly the way it's supposed to be solved. Our out-of-the-box solution solves these problems and I think, you know, if technologists can be more. About engaging with their clients. And we're in B2B software as a service, right? Um, you know, we typically don't just say, hey, what do you want? We say, this is what you should have. Um, [00:10:00] I think that makes for a much, much better value-added conversation because it leans directly into, well, what businesses care about, right? So, we sell B2B and so, you need to go to your clients and say, hey, this solution will drive these kinds of benefits. And let me explain to you why as opposed to this solution could drive all sorts of benefits. Tell me what you want to solve with it. It's a very fundamentally different way of approaching business, in our opinion.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnaga:</b> Can you walk us through some of the biggest challenges you faced while building and growing CHRP technologies?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Chin Ma:</b> I think. I feel like, I feel like I could literally just go and say, lemma just, uh, record my last 24 hours. I think as an entrepreneur, um, you encounter challenges every single day. Yeah. Um, what is today? It's the 17th of 2023. And so the last week as an example, um, It's been a big problem. , for those of you that are listening months from now, or years from now, um, there was major news in the last week where SVP, uh, Silicon Valley Bank, you know, first Republic and a bunch of other regional banks, um, um, add some liquidity issues and those liquidity issues are so systemic that, um, there was contagion in fear that banks were going to fail. and as an entrepreneur. Right. Okay, great. Like, how does that impact my business? Well, if you can't access cash, then you can't pay vendors. You can't make payroll. Um, and so we'd had, we had to make some pretty, uh, sizable decisions over the course of the last week to be able to make sure that we are well hedged against those types of problems. So that's just last week. You know, I would say another example is, um, when I personally had to make the decision to, to, to, to, to, to go into entrepreneurship, my background, um, was in management consulting. Looked for a top three management consultancy, uh, doing, um, digital transformation operation strategy, and pure go-to-market strategy for. Insurance companies and other financial services firms, I was paid a lot of money to do a thing that I really loved, and I invested well over a decade, um, in that job. Um, making the decision to say, hey, I'm going to choose entrepreneurship where very practical things are, right? Like, oof, I'm not going to see a paycheck come into my bank account every two. My gosh, I'm not going to have the resources that I used to have, right? To be able to call any expert in the world to say, hey, I have a problem. Can you help me think through this? Or even calling prospective clients and having them pick up the phone because they know that I'm from that company. Um, all of these things were swirling through my mind and, uh, it took me a while. It took me a while to make the decision. To jump into entrepreneurship, to jump into launching CHRP and focus on it deliberately as my day-to-day job, as an example. Um, and so I would say, you know, those two examples, right? One that happened really recently, and one, um, even at the commencement of my journey, um, were, were, were definitely two thin things that I, I would, you know, I would say are two challenges. We could literally have a conversation for five hours to talk to you about all the challenges over the course of time. But yeah, I know we don't have, those would be top Right.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> So, we talked about the challenges, uh, but what kind of advice can you, you know, offer to aspiring entrepreneurs who are looking to start their own tech companies or any business?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Chin Ma:</b> Yeah, listen, I think, um, I think hindsight is 2020 and. As a senior leader yourself, you've experienced a lot of challenges and boy, the storytelling now in hindsight, um, everything sounds so great, right? Um, if I go back to my first challenge of jumping ship and how long it took me, um, the biggest thing that I would tell every single entrepreneur is, you know, what you have. Um, if, if you deal with, um, a high variation in your day-to-day activities, well, um, and you have a distinct vision and value proposition in what you want to accomplish, take risks, take risks often and jump. I think those are the things that I would probably say I, I, I look at, you know, my own career and the joy that I get every single day as an entrepreneur. Um, I would say I've gotten more joy in two years than I ever did working for someone else. Um, but I've also never worked harder and it's fun. It's fun building something that you're really passionate about. It's fun building it with a team that you are invested in and that you brought in. It's fun making mistakes and seeing, you know, your baby being conceived to when it's moving into, at least for us, an adolescence. And so, um, if you have those three things, an idea, grit and the ability to deal with a high variation of stuff throughout your day-to-day, month to month, week to week. Then I say, man, just go for it. Um, you're oftentimes goanna find a lot of positivity, whether if it's just personal and professional competency development, or you know, hopefully you have something amazing and it grows into something very, very meaningful in our market. Right.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> So ultimately, most days you will have been very tired after the day end, but that, that supply of tiredness, that will give you the most satisfied sleep because you know this is your own pain. You are, you're shaping up something and it's going to be big. And, and, and when you, when you go to bed, having a feeling of satisfaction, new contentment, that's the best thing.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Chin Ma:</b> Yeah. Yeah. And I think, and I think it, you know, I mean, listen as, as pretty and beautiful as you can make it sound, um, you know, you're also pushing a gigantic rock up a mountain that looks and feels like Mount Everest. Right? Right. Um, but I'll tell you man, when you push that rock to base camp one, the amount of joy that you get there, it's. Unbelievable exhilaration. Yeah. You get it up to base camp two and then you're just like, what? You know, like we did this, I did this. I did it with my team. Right? When you're able to make the call, meaning it's your business, so you can say, you know what, we are going to do this. The best feeling in the world. Right.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> You talk about team, and I'm sure, uh, while, you know, running a business, you, you got to work with a lot of partners, vendors for your business. So how do you evaluate their capabilities and trustworthiness? Because I, I, I'm sure that the aspects, while partnering up with someone.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Chin Ma:</b> The most important thing is the relate. Um, capabilities are important, right? I mean, we, we do, uh, we have a lot of software technology, and we work with software technology vendors that are experts in certain things like, you know, partner software's that we might want to integrate with and so on and so forth. And, you know, our guiding principle has always been, do we. And can we trust these people? Mistakes and challenges and maturity of capability and competency can generally all be mitigated by that alone, but what makes a relationship is what happens when the proverbial S H I t hits the fan. And what you realize is the people that you have great relationships with and trust with, um, that are possibly introduced to you by someone who you really deeply trust. Those are typically the people and the organizations that will navigate through trial and tribulation much better with you than everybody is successful during good times. But the partners that we've chosen, we know that in the next five years that isn't the 2010s where growth and cheap capital is prevalent. We know that these partners are goanna be our partners through these, this next decade, which will be inherently, ne more challenging than the previous decade. And so, um, you know, those are the things that we look at. Um, and you know, we believe that relationship and trust. That's at the top of our selection criteria and who we choose to work for and with also belief in trust.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Fantastic. You know, as a company at FBSPL, we have developed everything around our customers. So, do you also believe in customer centricity is, uh, the ultimate competitive advantage?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Chin Ma:</b> Yeah, I mean, I think it goes without saying, um, if you don't treat your customers well and, you know, I think there's various levels, right? Um, even when we say what the value proposition of CHRP is and against, you know, compared to other technology companies, you know, we lead with advice first, not just, Hey, here's our software and it's really. um, we seek delight. Um, meaning, you know what I tell you that I will deliver for you, but every once in a while, and I mean every once in a while, meaning frequently once a month, every other month, you're delighting your customer and they're saying, wait a minute, you guys do that. That's so. I think that elevating your game in terms of customer centricity, at least for us, is always at the top of the food chain, right? Um, it's oftentimes easy to say, oh man, we're goanna be your best vendor, best partner. I mean, you know, you've, you pick up every single, if you picked up every single. Marketing call or answering every single marketing email. I don't think any human being that sells you their services, whether its lead gen business process outsourcing, or software technology is goanna sit there and say, yeah, our customer service sucks. Right. Okay. But I think it's demonstrated through custom customer centricity. It's demonstrated through. A rigorous focus around how we can help you grow, save money, and it's demonstrated through deliberate delight. Um, and so, I mean, the short answer to your question is hell yes, um, long-winded answer is I think the variation in Customer centricity is quite vast because no one will say, I do it badly. And so, for us, we, we typically focus on those kinds of things as our manifestation of customer centricity.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Fantastic. In, you know, with this case that how hard it can be, you know, being an entrepreneur and most of your days would be hectic.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Chin Ma:</b> KB, would you mind and just repeat that, just cut out a couple of words when you asked the question?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Sure. I, I, I was asking, you know, uh, it can be, uh, hiring, sometimes it can be long days. Said, how do you unwind after a long day at work? Play tennis?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Chin Ma:</b> Um, I love, I mean, goodness gracious man, why I think we're the greatest age of entertainment content. Known to man. So, my Spotify app, Netflix, hob, O Max, Hulu, Disney Plus. Um, my favorite show and I re-watched it, um, recently. One, one of my favorite shows, and I re-watched it recently, um, is Silicon Valley on HBO. Extraordinary there, I watched it probably in 2017 prior to being a tech entre. and I recently re-watched it, uh, with my fiancé and, um, it was extraordinary. It's like, oh my God, it's so funny, but it's also relatable indicative of the stuff that I went through over the course of my two-year journey. So, it kind of felt different for me. Uh, but yeah, um, you know, workout, tennis, all that kind of stuff. Watch some tv as you mention. You know, hikes and restaurants and all that good stuff. But, um, you know, you have to maintain a balance, man. Work and life are heavily intertwined when you're an entrepreneur and you have to make time for yourself.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Shekhar Dhabhai:</b> Yes. And this is a necessity now it is required if we'll not free our team members to think out of the box, they will be bound to a certain limit only.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Fantastic. And, uh, one last item on my list. So, as you could go back in time and give your younger self one piece of advice, what would that be?</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><section class='py-5'><div class='container'><div class='centered-heading'><h2 class='pb-4 podcast-main-heading'>Unravel New Possibilities</h2></div><div class='d-flex justify-content-center'><button type='button' class='PossibilitiesBtn active' id='ourGuest' onclick='showDiv(this)'>Our Guest</button><button type='button' class='PossibilitiesBtn' id='ourSpeaker' onclick='showDiv(this)'>Our Speaker</button></div><div class='d-flex'><div class='newPossibilitiesDiv d-flex flex-fill' id='ourGuestContainer'><div class='row p-2 p-md-4 my-auto'><div class='col-12 col-md-3 p-0'><img src='https://www2023.fusionfirst.com/img/devfusionfirst/podcast/Chin Ma.jpg' alt='Chin Ma' class='w-100 PossibilitiesImage'></div><div class='col-12 col-md-9 ps-md-4 d-flex flex-column py-3 py-md-0'><h2 class='fw-semibold text-orange mb-1'>Chin Ma<span class='float-end'><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/chinma/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noopener noreferrer'><img src='https://www2023.fusionfirst.com/img/devfusionfirst/podcast/linkedin.svg' class='linkedInIcon'></a></span></h2><h4 class='text-black fw-light mb-0'>The Founder and President of<a target='_blank' rel='nofollow noopener noreferrer' href='https://chrptech.com/' class='text-black fw-bold'> CHRP</a></h4><span class='PossibilitiesHR w-25 w-md-50 mt-2 d-flex'></span><p class='PossibilitiesParra mt-4 text-align fs-18p'>Chin Ma, the Founder and President of CHRP, a prominent player in the insurance industry.

So, let's roll out, can you tell us a bit about your background and how you got started in the insurance industry.</div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Michael Malfa:</b> Yeah. So, I started, quite early on in the insurance industry actually, right out of college. I jumped into the career, the insurance industry, not by, not by choice. I was actually, I was pursued by a friend of mine who was in insurance. I don't think any of us plan to get into insurance, early on, we all have big dreams and aspirations. Unfortunately, insurance isn't necessarily always at the top of the list. Right. But this individual is very persistent, and I turned them down a couple times, but they just kept persisting. And eventually, I decided to give it a try. You know, I tried it out and the first, my first job in insurance was for direct writer. The company was a Fairfax financial company, and they had a really great training program. It was an extensive training program where they would send us, you know, for two weeks at a time, on and off over several months. Anyhow, the training was excellent and after about a year into the business, I started to gain some traction and I started taking a, a real interest in the industry and haven't looked back since then.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Wow. Amazing. Kudos to that friend,</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Michael Malfa:</b> Yeah, exactly. If it wasn't for them, uh, I don't think we'd be sitting here.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Right. So that's how you started with the industry, but what inspired you to co-found Boardwalk Insurance and what sets your company apart from the other providers?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Michael Malfa:</b> Yeah, no, that's, that's a great question. Um, I guess I, after years and years on the distribution side, uh, and, you know, I was growing a commercial book of business. <b>I began to encounter this, this reoccurring problem. Uh, problem. There was a reoccurring theme or problem. Customers were looking for better service, uh, better service experience. And as a broker, I didn't really have the tools to deliver, uh, that experience. Like my time and reach was limited. I could only get to so many clients in a day. Uh, so, so there that was very challenging. So my partner and I started to, you know, research how technology could fill this void. </b>Things really hit home when, when Covid a. I'm sure you know, you experience as well, like the digital way of doing business had become the new norm. And when previously, you know, it, it wasn't as heavily adopted, especially in the insurance industry. Uh, you know, some other industries had adopted sooner and taken on more of, uh, more of a technology first approach. But insurance was, was just starting this, this digital transformation. So it was still early on. So my, my co-founder Andrew and I, we saw an opportunity. Uh, and after really lots of, lots of planning, lots of sleepless nights, lots of, uh, scribbled on napkins and extended stays at, uh, uh, cafes, Starbucks in particular, lots of Starbucks visits and a g a Gdrive full of documents. We, we decided, you know, to finally pursue it and, uh, we launched Boardwalk Insurance in March of 2021.</p><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Wow. You know, Starbucks might not know that, but a lot of businesses have started from there.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Michael Malfa:</b> Yeah, absolutely. You know…</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> They should have something like a startup corner in their cafes.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Michael Malfa:</b> It's a great idea Kb, you know, it really fosters that creativity when you're sitting there, you know, in that hustle and bustle, a busy environment. You hear that, that noise, you have a coffee it, it is a very creative atmosphere. Believe it or not.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Absolutely. Absolutely. So we talked about technology a bit. I understand that insurance started, the journey a little late, with the tech changes. But how has technology impacted the insurance industry in recent years, and how is Boardwalk Insurance adapting to these changes?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Michael Malfa:</b> Yeah. So I think, you know, like you said, like we mentioned, they were, they were a little bit late to commence their pursuit in the techno technological space. But insurers, I don't want to discount it, insurers do realize the importance of technology, you know, and they're trying to embed it in, in what all their future endeavors and what they're doing now. The issue is, You know, they have to transition off very outdated legacy systems. You know, these systems are very deep-rooted into their processes and procedures and their, their training manuals. So, you could imagine these large insurers having to uproot all of their, you know, their processes and training and technology to facilitate these new tools that are coming into the marketplace. Not to mention like all the data that they have, you know, there's, there's policy data, there's client data that's being housed in these legacy systems. So, you know, they have to migrate all that information over to any new SaaS products they're looking at. And that's been happening here in Canada with, the implement of Guidewire. A lot of insurers are transitioning over to Guidewire, but it's been. A very slow and difficult process for the insurers. We've seen it, we've seen the pain they've been going through, and a lot of the employees are so used to, you know, operating with their traditional technology. Right, right. You know, they're not so keen to adapt to these new ways and they're not, they're not adopting the technology or the new processes as well as some of these large insurance companies had hoped. So, it's, it's definitely a challenge. Now with, with Boardwalk, we're a startup. We're a startup. We're small, we're agile. You know, we look for every opportunity to embed technology, in what we do to make, to make it better than before. And this philosophy has existed from the beginning since we started, and it's now become part of our culture. All our team is on board with it. They're passionate about technology, they're excited whenever we can leverage it to do things better. And that's essentially, like I said, it's our culture now. It's embedded in everything we do.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Right, right. And, and being agile. I think it's, it's the key. If, if you're not open to changes, if you're not adapting or adopting, I think you are, you're leaving behind. Yeah. You, you are. No more in the game for a long time.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Michael Malfa:</b> Yeah, Moss. Moss doesn't grow on a rolling stone, as they say, and we, we all can give many examples, not to name any names, but many examples of companies that failed to adopt, you know, and wow. And you're, you're right, they got left behind.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Michael Malfa:</b> Absolutely.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Michael Malfa:</b> Poor, poor blockbuster, you know, , brim. It just, it goes on and on.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Yeah, it's, it's a long list. So we gather that, you know, boardwalk Insurance has a reputation for providing exceptional customer service. Can you tell us a bit more about how your team works with clients you provide customized or personalized, uh, solutions, and how do you keep your clients happy in a way?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Michael Malfa:</b> Yeah, so I guess, like we're in commercial insurance, so in insurance in general, we're in an industry that sells an intangible product, a product that some customers may never even use. So, customer service is sometimes the only variable that we're assessed on. That's the only area we sometimes get the opportunity to vu customers on or to wow customers on. Sorry. So, another thing is we're dealing with small to medium-sized business owners. So, they're running a business. Everything is time sensitive. It's, we're always working with deadlines and, you know, given that, having that ability to be accessible and provide prompt service is critical in our business. So, I guess your second part of the question was how we're delivering that exceptional experience, KB?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Yeah. Yeah.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Michael Malfa:</b> Okay. So, I would say that it's a combination of things. It's a combination of training processes and the embedding of technology into it. So, we'll try to automate as much as we can on the tech side. We have a very robust CRM system and a back-end policy management system, so we'll use as much technology as we can to allow our team to be aware of every single necessary touch point with a customer. We have reminder systems set up. We have, we have touchpoints automated with the client. We have checkers going on in the background, checking certain things when a policy's changed or when a client changes. So, we use that technology to help us stay on top of, stay ahead of the curve. And then we just leverage, I guess I would say the human element. Cause at the end of the day, we can’t lose sight of that people still want to talk to a, to a human in many cases, and they need the, in our industry, they need the advice, the service and the expertise of someone that understands their business and understands, how to protect their business using, products in the marketplace. So, we try to really have a nice blend of both using technology to enhance our staff, to be able to deliver that human element better, more efficiently.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Yeah, I think human element is always the prime requirement. You know, empathy because, I, as a user, hate IVRs and chat bots. Yeah. Because at a certain point I feel like I need someone who I can talk to, who can understand my problem and. Even if the solution is not there, at least I would feel a little satisfied that someone is listening to me. So, yeah, humans are always a top priority, so thanks for that. And what advice would you give to other companies looking to improve their customer experience?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Michael Malfa:</b> Yeah, absolutely. And just, you know, I want to just add to that as the backend process, like there's a lot of backend processes and I know you're very familiar with this. Those don't necessarily add immediate value to the customer, So, we don't want to tie up our staff with a, a lot of heavy backend lifting. Like if we can, if we can alleviate that burden from them so they could focus more on those customer touchpoints and delivering that customer relationship experience, that's what we're always trying to. And then now back to your question. Yeah. The advice I give, that I would give is just make sure you're utilizing number one, the tools that are available. A lot of the CRMs now have tons of tools for, service tickets, monitoring, your, your SLAs, your service level agreement. Also, KPIs, like we set up KPIs for our service team. So, when our service team's being trained, they're aware of our service level agreements, how long it takes to fulfill certain requests, and they're aware of how we're assessing their performance. There're key performance indicators that we've outlined, and then we use the tools out in the market. To assess these, like how long as it takes for an average ticket to be resolved. You know, the triage process, how when it gets triaged, how it gets triaged. So again, that comes down to training processes, manuals, and technology.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Oh cool, let's talk some fun. So, what's the most unusual item in your office?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Michael Malfa:</b> Unusual item. Yeah, there's a couple. Okay, so , one of 'em is pretty funny. We have battle bots in our office.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Oh, wow.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Michael Malfa:</b> And they're little romo control robots that our staff can control, and they fight with each other. So, whenever there's a disagreement, they take it out in the ring, they get their battle bots, and they start, and they hash it out with their robots.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> I thought, this is so cool.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Michael Malfa:</b> Yeah, it's fun. It's so much fun. And also, I got it on a trip when we were on, a trip to New York. Wow. Um, there's that large toy store in New York. The name is not coming to me, but they have every single toy you can ever imagine, and it does bring out the big kid in you. We also have a Tibetan gong, like a real Tibetan gong that our sales staff hits when they make a sale. Whenever a sale's made, they hit this gong and the whole office celebrates with it. Well, that's pretty fun too.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Oh, we have something similar. So, we do not have the gong, but we have those chiming bells. In every workstation or lab. So why we, how we use this is like, after every hour or so of work, we do two or three minutes of fun things because, we don't want to be monotonous. And science says that if, if we are not taking short breaks after 60 minutes, 90 minutes, then you are not as attentive as you should be. So, we keep on the, it can be just relaxing, it can be just singing or whatever. But yeah, we knock out the bill and everyone is like having fun at that time. So, Gong is amazing. I should have it implemented in my sales team.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Michael Malfa:</b> Yeah. And I love that idea too. I've read that you're right, it's proven after 60 or 90 minutes. If you don't take a break, you're not as effective, even for mental health, it's important, right? So, I'm definitely gonna take that one and implement it cuz after long days in the office, you do start to burn out. You lose the creative juice right after so many hours of just staring at that monitor.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Fantastic. So sure, and then, there, we just understand you enjoy reading. So, what is the most inspiring book you have ever read at? Why did you have such an, why did it have such an impact?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Michael Malfa:</b> Yeah, that's a tough one. Reading, you know, so many years of reading. But if I had to say one, like one that I recall, cuz it's very, I read it very early on and when you're young and impressionable and, some of these, these, these books or these messages from these individuals have such an impact on you. I would say one of 'em was Tony Robbins, Awakened the Giant. It really helped me open my eyes and realize that the world doesn't give us like what we think we deserve. It gives us what we're willing to go out and take. So that book talks about controlling your mental, emotional, and financial destiny. So, it was really interesting, like, it opened up my eyes to have been taken control. Of your destiny and not just being, a victim or a product of it. Everyone creates their own destiny. Right. And if you don't take action, don't expect results.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Yeah. You're not driving it. You are being driven by it.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Michael Malfa:</b> Exactly. Exactly. And you'll never be as happy when you're being driven by it. Because you're at the mercy of, of all these external variables when you're driving, when you're in the driver's seat, you control the narrative, you know?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> You know, there was something similar, regarding fate and destiny, in Alchemist. I'm not sure if you got a chance to read it, but, it says, if you want something desperately, the whole universe conspires to deliver it to you.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Michael Malfa:</b> Hmm. And what's that called? Kb?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> The book?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Michael Malfa:</b> Yeah, the book.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> It's, it's Alchemist.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Michael Malfa:</b> Okay. I'm gonna read. On my list.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> It is based on a fictional story, but with lots of life lessons. Ah, yeah. It's a good one.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Michael Malfa:</b> Nice. My partner's reading the Art of War right now, again for the second time. So that's another classic. Yes. And he's saying like, it's still so relevant today, even though it was written. Hundreds, maybe thousands of years ago. I'm not sure. It was written a long time ago. It's still, it's still so relative. And you're right, same thing. You can just apply it to so many aspects of day-to-day life.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Right. Well, finally, can you share any exciting new developments, or upcoming initiatives at Boardwalk Insurance that our listeners should be on the lookout?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Michael Malfa:</b> Yeah, sure. There's a lot in the pipeline, like, what I'm most excited for, I would say, is we have some really cutting-edge features coming to our system. Our backend system. They're quite large. They're big features and they're gonna double our speed, at least double our speed on customer intake. So, it's a combination of features that we're hoping to complete. Early to mid q3, and it's gonna allow us to onboard customers a lot more seamlessly, a lot faster, a lot simpler and essentially, you know, we can ramp up our sales ability by at least, at least 200% if, if all goes well. Without going into too much details, I can definitely bore you with the details, but, once they're, once they're live, I'll definitely share them with you KB. Once the first iteration MVP of it is live, you'll be the first to know.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> I'll be on the lookout for that. And this is also exciting. My best wishes. And if in any way we can be of help, please do let us know.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Michael Malfa:</b> Absolutely. I know it's, what you're doing is great and I'm looking forward to stand and talks with you. Kb appreciate it.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Well, Michael, thank you so much for your time and, it was fantastic talking to you. I'll share the podcast link as soon as it's out, and I enjoyed our conversation today.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Michael Malfa:</b> Likewise, looking forward to it.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep “KB” Bhatnagar:</b> Perfect.

So, insurance was not on my radar at all.</div><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>And I graduated college in some other field, um, was working shortly thereafter in that field, uh, when Brian was beginning to open the agency here in Chapman Insurance Group. So, he had approached me at that time about possibly coming on board, um, and it was a great decision because it was a completely different direction than what I had considered.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Um, but just looking at the opportunity that was available, kind of the, the, uh, expecting a new challenge and, and having something, um, that was different and fun. I accepted the challenge and kind of came on board with him. So, we started as Gemma four, um, in our home office in Port Charlotte. And, uh, from there we, we grew, um, you know, I kind of joke now, we, we still have the same four people that started lifework are still a part of our team today.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>So, it's kind of cool cause we can sit around the table, we can joke about, you know, the first days where you're waiting for the phone to ring and kind of like, what's going to happen here? What's going on? And just kind of seeing that business evolve from where it was when to where it is now. I've been able to be a part of that growth and see that first.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Uh, it's been going from that team of four to now over 65, take one, or to five different locations. Um, so along with that, obviously it didn't go from four to 65 overnight. That's been a path and a journey of breath. Um, we're just about to complete our 14th year, so going into our 15th year of business.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>We, we have grown our team. We've responded to the means of our community. We've been able to be very involved in our community, um, and have had, uh, tremendous support from them, which has allowed us to grow the way that we have. So, kind of involving for my role on day one of, hey, let's just write business.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Let's have fun doing it. Let's, you know, um, respond to a need that we've seen in our community and former. Into, okay, now I'm taking on, um, the role of managing our team and the operations of Chapman insurance group. So, it, it's evolved through time. Um, a lot of different hats have been worn throughout that period of time.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Um, but I'm thankful for where we're at today and the kind of joy that brought us to this point.</p><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Wow. Amazing journey. You know, and I can totally relate, you know, when you're the part of the foundation team, the core pilot team, and where you see your company, your team growing, it feels amazing. It really feels amazing.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Janessa Weiland:</b> Yeah. There's a lot of, a lot of blood sweat and tears that go into the initial day and kind the foundation of things. So, to see that come full circle and to be able to, um, see our team grow, has been, has been something special.</div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Amazing. So, you're moving into the 15th year of business. Um, out of all those years, what's the best piece of advice you have ever received?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Janessa Weiland:</b> I think capacity than advice probably isn't insurance related at all. Um, but it's more just about people and it's about, um, taking the time to listen. So, listen before you speak. I feel like my mom ingrained that in me when I was younger. Um, and might, might have come from a place of, hey, let your parents talk to you before you have something to say.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>But I think as I've grown, that kind of stuck with me and something that has reverberated in a lot of different environments that I've been a. Professionally of just hearing, hearing what people have to say, feel like we can be more thoughtful in our responses. We can be more genuine, right? We should relate with people when we can stop and listen to what they have to say before reaching the time to speak.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>And I think that that's something that has allowed me to succeed in my role internally by relating with my team and hearing the needs of my team as well as externally with our customers. I encourage our team to always kind of start. That was with the question to our customers of, hey, what's important to you in this experience that we can understand better how we can meet their needs and how we can speak, uh, to something that's valuable to them.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Oh, this is a fantastic piece of advice. And, uh, I am also a big, uh, you know, believer of this piece because, I'm in sales and before that we were lot into customer interactions. So, I always suggest this to my team as well. Mm-hmm. Listen twice as much as you speak because uh, that's when you know what someone needs, what they are looking forward to from you.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>And in that way, you respect what the, what someone is trying to say to you versus when you are just thinking that what you have to say next it's like, you know, three people just arguing and no one is listening to each other. Yes. Such an amazing piece of advice. Fantastic. Now, when we are talking about, uh, you know, listening relationships and people, uh, how do you approach building and maintaining relationships with the clients and you know, your customers?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Janessa Weiland:</b> Yeah, so obviously an important part of what we do. We wouldn't be here if it weren't for our clients. Um, so how do we relate? How do we build that? I think it goes back to what we just talked about, uh, first with me. What are the needs that our clients have? What's the problem that they're facing, um, that we can provide a solution for?</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Um, and, and just being genuine in that. I think that when you care for people, um, that is evidence in your work and in your communication with them. And so just being able to kind of build that connection, that relationship as an independent agency, um, we thrive from a relationship. Um, it's all about, you know, creating a relationship with the client and making them a fan of yours, should they tell other people about you? Um, and, and for that starts with just taking the time to listen, being genuine, you know, taking any, um, interest in something other than insurance. Um, you know, having that conversation with them about something that. Relate to them on, on a different level.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>It's not always fun to talk about insurance because you know, it's not always the most exciting topic. So outside of that kind of understanding who they are, the person, and finding those ways that we can relate to.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Yeah, no other people versus knowing the business. Yeah. Yeah. Fantastic. Uh, alright. And can you, can you also share some insights on the company's approach to promoting new ideas?</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Uh, and what, what steps has Chapman Insurance Group taken to encourage its employees to think outside the box and push the boundaries of what's possible?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Janessa Weiland:</b> Absolutely. So, I, and yeah, I think as an organization we've actually done, a pretty good job, I'd like to say, by kids, uh, brag us for a minute. Just being open to new ideas.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>I feel like we are always encouraging, marching, and bringing that new idea to the table. You know, as a team member that's operating in a particular role, oftentimes they are the eyes and ears that are on kind of that front line as of what's going on. And so being willing to listen to nursing and take, like, take those opinions into consideration.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>And to value that opinion, that's something important to us one. And so, as a team member on our team, you know, we're constantly asking, hey, what is your idea? Um, what, here's a problem that our customers are facing or that we are facing as an organization? How do we collaborate together to find this solution for it?</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Um, so we've done a good job of creating a platform. We have departmental meetings that meet on a weekly basis. Where we talk about issues, where we say, hey, what are the challenges that we're facing? And then trying to collaborate together using the knowledge and the experience that our team has collectively to say, how do we meet these challenges?</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Where at, how do we provide solution? And thinking outside of the box and, and then being able to say, okay, we have an idea. Let's implement it. What does that look like? You know, so many ideas stop there. They stop with the thought. Um, and they don't go beyond that point. They're just taking it. That next step of, okay, what is the action step?</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>What is the first step that we can take to implement, um, a solution here? And, um, being open to those ideas, implementation. Signup foundation for us to be able to grow and our heaven is adaptable of an organization, which for our industry and for our client base on that, that's very valuable.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> And I'm sure when they see their ideas getting to happen, they think of more, they feel connected to the company as well.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>And, and that's, uh, what, uh, builds a company culture as well of, you know, openness and transparency. Yeah. Oh, and, and, you know, I, I keep on hearing these days and, and I'm, I'm feeling it as well globally, the, the economy is, uh, not doing as well as it should be. In talking in particular about insurance, uh, when I meet, the professionals, they say hiring is becoming a challenge or, or, you know, uh, so as a company, in your opinion, what are some of the biggest challenges facing the industry right now, and how do you see these challenges being at addressed?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Janessa Weiland:</b> That's a loaded question cause there's so many, so many different, um, perspectives you can take on this. Um, I feel like nationally the challenges for the insurance industry are probably a little bit different than they are locally. Uh, so as mentioned at the beginning, you know, we are based in Florida, uh, and anybody that has probably been around over the last year knows Florida has had a difficult year.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Yeah. And we've had some dorms that have hit us pretty hard, and the effects of those, the impact of them, um, specifically on the insurance industry have been demanded it so. There are challenges that we're seeing and facing because of that and there're more local challenges. So, we've taken the approach of, you know, trying to be as politically involved as we can in an agency and have more innovation to advocate on behalf of our clients.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Um, being involved in those decisions that are being made, being involved is educating our clients and, um, communicating with them, hey, here's what's going on. Here's how you can get involved; here's how you can make an impact on those decisions that are being made. But then naturally, I think some of those challenges are, are unique as well.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>I see that, um, as the insurance industry, um, you know, our client has different needs and demands, and those are constantly changing and evolving as time goes on. Right. Um, you know, it used to be that you could pick up the phone and call somebody and they would answer the phone. Um, not as easy as that these days.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Yeah. Um, no. This person prefers an email. This person prefers a text. This person prefers a phone call. Um, this person wants you to leave a message and they'll call you back and it might be after hours. And so just being innovative to be able to respond to, um, those different needs of our client had signed a challenge.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Um, and, you know, along with that, Carriers, insurance carriers, um, are probably what I'm, you know, in Zems terms, I'm going to say pickier than they have been before. Yeah. Um, now they just take a more conservative approach right now on the big that they're taking in because they're wanting to evaluate their risk and making sure that it makes financial spend for them.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Um, so it in time when they're kind of in the spotlight and under the microscope, they must respond by making conservative financial decision. So, some of that for us makes more work on our end. So right, what used to be a process of, hey, we, you know, have a conversation, we put together a quote and we complete an application, could be done in 30 minutes.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Now that, you know, a process that takes a couple hours at least and, and could potentially, um, be more involved in that than that, uh, the correct inspection. Okay, we got an inspection back and there's something that needs to be addressed. What means for us internally and the business, they're not, you need more hands, we need more people helping.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Um, and I think that is where, kind of being innovative and then um, understanding what options are out there. Um, you know, our relationship with Fusion has grown, uh, tremendously over the last year simply because of that reinvention. A lot of that I feel like was, uh, Sparked and spurred on, um, with some of the storm.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Um, and after the storm, you know, our mission team was able to be responsive and to help, and a time with our team. Literally could not. Yeah. And you know, we had a lot of team members that we had gear ability to communicate with. Um, we didn't have service, we didn't have, you know, cell phones. The things that we depend on a daily basis to operate as a business.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>We're no longer there. And so luckily, we had, you know, un team of people that, um, was able to engage, and then Fusion being able to be a part of that as being responsive. Uh, I think that was one of the, one of the moments that we just kind of sat back and said, okay, you know, this is something that we really must embrace, and we must understand that there are options, um, with technology these days that are outside of the box.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>And, and being able to be open to those ideas. And you know, just being involved in understanding what their adoptions are. Um, so certainly there's challenges that our insurance industry is facing and it's changing globally, but I think with those challenges come great opportunity. We've really tried to take the approach of, with each challenge we be there, have an opportunity underlying, and let's take that and, turn it around.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Well, this is really insightful, and I understand Florida has always. Unique in terms of the insurance domain because it's more complex. It's more challenging because of the late natural environment around it. Uh, right. And I can totally relate, uh, that time after the hurricane. In fact, I was there in Florida at that time.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Janessa Weiland:</b> Yeah. You were</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Running away from it. I think you were, have we traveled out Florida pretty quickly after that though, right? All Yeah, absolutely. As it hit Miami, uh, we rented a car. We drove thousand kilometers in a. And at the day and I was feeling like I'm a truck driver, but yes, it was, was a horrible experience to have.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>But, uh, like you, you know, the team was always there to support us, uh, whatever needed the communications to reschedule the meetings we were having and all that. So, yeah, I can relate and, and, uh, of course, nationally and locally, there are wide differences in the challenges. So, if it's more challenge, uh, for, for I think Chapman as in.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Because of, uh, Florida related, uh, consent. Okay. But I love the way the company's shaping up and it's growing and I'm so glad that we are a part of this growth journey.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Janessa Weiland:</b> Uh, we appreciate y'all being there.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Alright. So, uh, you know, I, we personally started this, uh, podcast because when we want to see a lot of inter trends and developments or, or we want to have some resources around the insurance world, we do not find many.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>So, we thought Net Server Place where at least, you know, uh, audience, uh, who are into insurance. Can get some, you know, translated, uh, discussions and, and discussions around operations and whatnot. So how do you stay up to date on industry transit developments? Are there any resources you would recommend to others?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Janessa Weiland:</b> Um, so for us, I think the most valuable resources are relationships, um, you know, leverage a relationship. Who are you? Jillian Desmond. And not necessarily business as a client, that business as an organization around the company. Um, you know, I know that fusion is not specific to helping insurance agencies.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Um, it expands across other businesses as well. Um, but I would say using a resource of, um, you know, where are they? Where are those companies? Most companies operate as BRM or some type of management system. Right. Um, internally we have a relationship with Apply Applied, doing a great job of connecting, um, and, and getting resources, making resources available, um, for not only things that are happening in the insurance industry, but opportunities, um, keeping information fresh and um, making sure that people are in the know of what's going.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>So, I feel like, you know, internally we have a relationship with Applied. We use them on a daily basis. Our team is familiar with them. How can we utilize what they're already offering and make sure we're taking advantage of that? So, taking in a relationship authority there and utilizing the resources that they're providing.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>There's an endless number of resources and a lot of times that just collaboration with other insurance. Paid, what are they doing? Um, how are they doing it? It reminds me somebody, you know, in Seattle or I think somebody in New York, I feel like, you know, there's been plenty of times where I've been on the phone with somebody that's in a completely different state, but we've said, hey, this is a challenge that we're being with our agency.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>How have you guys met this challenge? Or what have you learned? And so just having that platform as um, you know, something you have in common that you're able to collaborate on and, and say, uh, you know, what are the ideas, what are the resources? Um, what are the things you're using and being, and doing, um, and being able to share that.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>So, I feel like we've always kind of taken the approach of, um, being transparent and sharing and we want others to succeed. And so, if anything that we can learn along the way that we can share with others, we want to provide that information. I know that, uh, for us as well, being specific to Florida, there's a, um, organization at FBSPL that has been a huge resource for us.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Um, so Florida's, uh, association of independent insurance agent and, um, they do a lot for connecting, uh, insurance agency fee and for, uh, making sure that they're staying involved in the decisions that are happening in. And being able to communicate things out to agencies and to the community of what's going on and being able to be a resource to provide, um, for direction and or just connection.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Um, being able to connect with individuals that can share information with you and help you along the way. I feel like you'll be a huge part of any visit, visit, fact. You have to learn how to connect with the right people and be able to share ideas and collaborate.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Yeah, I have never looked at it that way, um, at this amazing. Your network, your contacts, your relationships. They can be the biggest source of information or recent fence. Ah, really? When I think more about it, it totally makes sense. Amazing insight on this one. Thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely. Well, so it's, it's been, uh, quite a while with the company. Can you discuss a particular memorable achievement or a project, uh, in your, uh, insurance career thus far?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Janessa Weiland:</b> Um, so the one that strike out to me, um, and I would say probably this is ongoing, but every time we open a new office, um, it's kind of a project that we take on and, you know, being a part of, um, since day one I've been able to kind of be a part of each project along the way, have come along if we opened our different location. Um, and we have plans for continued growth so that, you know, a project that's kind of, uh, continuing as we move forward into the future. So, I think this, watching that go from a thought and an idea, um, and the beginning stages of empathy where you're, you know, you're trying to decide, okay, where is that location going to be and who's gonna work in that location and what is the infrastructure that's needed? And just those decisions that you're kind of making at the very beginning to seeing it all come together, um, and seeing the team. I think that's something that's exciting for me because, fulfill, you know, when you, when you're able to open a new location, you are expanding your footprint in the community. We're expanding, you know, our offering for bringing people on board and opportunities to join our team. And, um, along with that I say just comes with satisfaction of being, you know, a decision made of, hey, we're gonna do this, and then the follow through of that and being able to see that, um, love Haitian grow and fix.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>So, I think along the way, I think that's probably some of the things that I'm, you know, most proud of and just, um, proud to be a part of. It's just the growth that we have had and the project is taking a new location, um, opening that and, um, seeing, you know, seeing that office sometimes open, switch two people and, and then, you know, seeing that grow to the team of 15 years, team of 16, uh, and being able to see them kind of operate fully in that momentum. Um, that's it.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Yeah. Yeah, I can I get that. Have that. Wow. And so, you know, it's, it's a team of about 65 members now, right? Yes. It's, it's, it's, and I'm sure the customer base is also growing. That's why the team is growing. Yeah. So as the chief operating, it's, it's lots of work, right? So how do you prioritize and manage your workload?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Janessa Weiland:</b> Oh, I must laugh a little bit because that's a challenge on a lot of days. Um, but I think though, I think the concept that I have adopted that has been gosh successful for me is just trying to start every day with a clear focus. So, you know, as a beginning, how does the day begin and how does it end?</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>And, if we can kind of control those factors, I feel like the middle part goes a lot more smoothly. So, you know, starting the day with, if we are focused off, hey, what late, what are the priori priorities? Taking that little bit of time at the first part of the day to make sure that you know everything that's going on.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Checking in with individuals that I need to check into to understand, hey, what are the needs today? What are the priorities? But I think the thing that has been most helpful for me is, um, just I try to take the mindset of, um, always being responsive. So whether it's to my team internally or whether it's to a client externally or whether it's, um, to a business partner, um, you know, I'm not perfect in that, but I would say my goal is to DS responses and want my team member to know that if they, if they send me something, then I'm gonna.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Um, and sunshine is the response that, you know, sounds, you know, hey, I receive this, and this is one you can expect to hear back from me on it. Um, but we always encourage our team, well, like setting the expectation with the client is important because it allows you to be on the same page. It allows you to have clear expectations.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Um, you know, if there's no clear expectations, expectations are going. Not be met in some situation if they might not be the same, right? Um, so being responsive to a client, being responsive to a team member, letting them know, hey, here's what you can expect. I should have this completed by X date or should have this over to you by.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Two o'clock today or whatever. Just, just creating that clear expectation. Yeah, that'll, I feel like even though on days where it's really hard, um, because you might have a lot of different things coming at you, just being clear, um, and being, taking the time to give somebody a, a quick response and letting them know, Hey, here's what you can expect.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Um, I feel like that's, that's something that has allowed me to be able to prioritize and put things in order. So, it's not always, you know, not always being reactive to what's coming at me, but being more proactive and being able to say, okay, this is when I can complete it. This is the timeline that I can put it in.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>And then it helps me organize things on my end. So, Uh, yes, certainly. You know, there's days where the unexpected happens when it pulls you in different directions and you must be able to, to adapt to those. So, I think the more responsive that we can be, the way that we start a day, the way that we end today, that's gonna determine how it's gonna go.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>And so those, those couple principles re been helpful for me in my role to be able, um, to manage the day to day.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Wow, And, you know, again, as the team is about 65 and it's still growing. Uh, so what approach does Chapman Insurance Group take to attract and retain talent and what qualities are valued in a provincial new hire?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Janessa Weiland:</b> This is a fun one because you know, honestly, we've, we've added a lot of team members, so we'd have some practice along the way. Um, but you. A lot of a lot of businesses take the, um, approach of, you know, putting a post out there for a job posting, will you the same? but we, we also try to utilize the resources of relationship, you know, asking team members, hey, do you know somebody?</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Um, do you know somebody? That would be great. I feel like when you have a team that is invested in the culture that you created as an organization, as and as a company, they're excited. They want other people that they know to experience that same thing. If they're happy with where they work, they tell that to others, and those opportunities that will be there come back.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>But that's what Sophies probably feel like we've taken. Um, you know, what are those relationships? Who do we know? Um, you know, making sure our team knows when we're looking to fill a position. And you know how it is, maybe somebody knows somebody, maybe there's somebody on our team that is better suited for that role, right?</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Um, so I feel like yes, we take the organic approach of job hosting, and you'll see those online, but also internally, utilizing the relationship that we have. Because I think one of the things that we really put on such a star is choosing the right people. And, you know, Part of the culture that we've created to us been, you know, important for us to protect.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>That's one of the biggest things that we can give to our employees, right? It is a good working place. You know, we want it the day to day and what you do can sometimes be exhausting, but what you're doing, what doing it with people that you enjoy being around and then you're doing it, you know, with people that are willing to celebrate your successes and cheer you on along the way and encourage, It makes all the difference in the world and the protecting that environment for our team has been important.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Um, we have internally, we have kind of our list of core values that we all, um, rate each other on. And, it's part of our, you know, day-to-day talk. We're constantly talking about it, recognizing core values that our team has this great. And for us it's pretty simple. Um, but you know, when we're looking, uh, to bring the learn, uh, a new team member, that's the things that we're looking at.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Do they share the same values that we have? Uh, are they gonna fit into the culture of our team? Um, because the culture of our team means you're gonna work hard, but we're gonna have fun doing it. And, you know, we're gonna accept challenges and we're gonna step up to the plate. And we're gonna know, you know, we're gonna encourage each other.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>We're gonna create a positive and fun environment. Um, but we're gonna have results at the end of the day. So, you're gonna be held to a standard and you're gonna be, you know, the bar is gonna be set, um, for, for you to achieve. Um, so yet it's a high standard. but it's also something not, I feel like if you never accept the challenge, you don't know what you're capable of.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>And so just motivating each other in that positive way, uh, has been something that's important to us. So, I think initially, um, we can't always gauge a person by, you know, a one-hour interview, but, but you can get a pretty good idea if they share those things for about, that you have as a team. So, I'm unified and those things, I feel like it's easier and easier to find, uh, the right person, to fit into.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Yeah. So, it's not just the talent, but the fit, the, the cultural fit and the national fit is very important.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Janessa Weiland:</b> Absolutely. Clearly, and sometimes even more important than the challenge. You know, we, we say we can teach you insurance. Um, put the, the things that you can't teach are, you know, those values that somebody has. Yes. And just kind of those innate characteristics on those can't be taught. So, if they have those, you can teach them.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> So, uh, you know, I, I've seen the company growing consistently be all know that, and, uh, and, and you're very aggressive about it as well. So how does Chapman Insurance balance the need for growth and expansion with maintaining financial stability as.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Janessa Weiland: </b>So, we, from day one, I mean, Brian hadn't, um, kind of adopted a philosophy of, hey, we're, we're gonna grow. Um, and so from day one, the idea, um, the original idea was, you know, multiple offices, um, you know, he wanted to have two in a certain period of time and wanted to have five in a certain period to work to that point.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Now Rick's like, okay, we've gotten there now what Nick? Um, so, you know, chatting that vision out further into the. But if you wanna grow, you have to take risks. And that's something that, um, I feel like we've always understood, but at the same time, you take risks in a calculated way. Um, I, I think that we, first, good leadership.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Um, I feel like Brian Chapman is the owner. And, um, he'd done a great job of being involved in the day-to-day casting vision for our team and helping us calculate those Ds along the. I think the biggest hindrance is that people run into, whether it be intra or these, or just in general, like, um, you know, being stuck to making that an idea succeed.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>And, um, I feel like that's when people fail, um, because they're so stuck on making this idea succeed. I think the key is being able to be adaptable, um, and being able to say, okay, this, this is the original plan, but it's not working. So, you know, how, how can, how can we change? How can we. So, I think that we have kind of done a good job of, um, bordering that, uh, risk, um, versus, you know, taking that risk in a calculated way, uh, and, and protecting that we know we wanna grow, so there's gonna be risk involved in that.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Um, but we have to make a good financially sound decision. And, um, part of that is just making sure that there's measures in sight. You know, everybody on our team. A number that they're responsible for being accountable for. And so easy to see when somebody is, is off track. Um, and you know, it might start as one person, but it's worth seeing, okay, an entire team is off tracked, and they're off tracked.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Obviously, there's an issue there and something is working. And so having the measures in place, um, to be able to hold ourselves accountable to making smart decisions for our team and for the organization. And think, you know, we might have an idea, we might run with it. Um, and, but being willing to say, okay, this isn't working.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Let's push direction and being able to recognize that. But there's metrics that, you know, when a decision is made for growth, um, there's metrics that have to be met. And if it's not working, then we have to say, okay, we have to push direction. We have to make a change here. Or why isn't it working and how can we make this.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>So being able, um, to be adaptable in that way and just constantly evaluating those things, having a pulse of what's going on within the agency, within our team, um, from performance as individual to performance as an, an entire organization and business. Uh, being able to make the decision sometimes of, all right, let, let's switch direction, or let's change something up.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Something up, I feel like we've been able to do well. Um, and that's based on the feedback that we get from our team and that communication that we're constantly having from our team.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Right, okay. You, you cannot achieve until you aspire. So of course, you have to have aspirations and you have to have a big, otherwise, uh, the growth is always slower. It's not there. Right Fantastic. So, on the lighter side of things, what's your favorite guilty pleasure snack,</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Janessa Weiland:</b> Oh, I, I feel like there's probably a long list there. Um, but you know, in the, the intro, one of the things my husband and I enjoy is the, that we like try a new local spot. We're, we're, I guess foodie, if you can call it.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Um, so, you know, we're always trying to look for a new spot. Um, Exciting adventure. And um, I think with that just come having an open mind, being, being willing to try a new thing. So, uh, I would say my favorite food is hands down Thai food. So, if I'm, um, going out for a meal, um, that's gonna be my choice.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Um, that would be my go-to, probably nine times out of 10. Um, well, but it's a, you know, had long weekend, it's a Friday night and relaxing on the couch is definitely bowl ice cream. Um, I, it's a joke in our house. My husband always rings, tell him a, a half-gallon of ice cream. What? He knows. I've had a hard week and I, I mean, hopefully I don't eat that whole thing, but, um, I always tell, please don't bring me ice cream home.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>But, but, but you like it so much, why wouldn't I? Vanilla so, I get to use, supporting some of my guilty pleasures a bad decision.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Oh, you must because, uh, you know, you would expect the same from your spouse, right? Yeah, no, I ice cream is my go-to too, so I can totally relate.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Janessa Weiland:</b> What flavor is your favorite?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Oh, uh, uh, sometimes I like hazelnuts. Uh, then, uh, then one of them is a rare one. Uh, big. But, uh, you know, I like it.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Janessa Weiland:</b> I haven't had that one.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Sure, you'll like it. Cool. And then I promise, this is my last one. So, what advice would you give to someone just starting out in this industry?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Janessa Weiland:</b> Um, It's a marathon, not a ray. Um, I feel like, you know, when we bring in new team member on board, and especially one that doesn't have insurance experience, the first conversation that we have is, Hey, let's have a realistic expectation here because you doing a job that you're gonna come in, you know, and train for three weeks and know everything you need to know.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Um, you know, there might be certain roles that are easier to trade on, but, um, being involved in the insurance industry and, and investing in, in the insurance industry as a. Is an investment and it's an investment that, um, you know, will pay off and it has a challenge as well. Um, but you can't go into it with the expectation of I'm gonna learn everything or know everything, uh, within a three-month period of time.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Um, we say, you know, kind of when you start off, we always see that you know, that six months, um, look on somebody's face where they're like, I don't think I’ll ever learn all this. Um, and then it's, you know, working through that. Um, and, and that's completely natural what you're feeling and being overwhelmed is completely natural and you'll get there and just kind of be encouragement and a tea and.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Um, but it takes time. And so being invested in that, the investment, you know, is something that if you're willing to put in, that is going to benefit you in the long run. And so just understanding that it's not a snap of a finger and, and an easy, uh, you know, an easy. Easy road at the beginning. Um, it's a lot of worry.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>It's a lot of, um, adapting. It's a lot of, you know, when you think you, when you think you have a good understanding, all of a sudden, the insurance industry changes somehow when everything gets mixed up again. So, I say like, to shake it up and just keep it interesting everyone in a while. Um, but with that, I say if permitted to running the race, um, then the, you know, crafting over that finish line and having, um, that.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>It is something that we'll follow. So just being patient and being willing to unbox them, knowing that, um, sometimes you, you have to kind of enjoy the ride along the way.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Wow. So, I have two catchphrases from here. It's Samaritan, not a race, and the last one was Enjoy the Ride.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Janessa Weiland:</b> Yes. Yeah, absolutely. Feel like we're present in the moment of each. Um, you know, we have to look for those things that are our best things along the way and keep ourselves, um, motivated in that way. So, if we're looking for the good, we'll find the good. If we're looking for the bad, we'll find the bad. So just keep a positive view and, um, just enjoy it.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Wow. So, with that note, uh, we are El today's podcast. Thank you so much Janessa. I enjoyed the conversation. I hope that you did as well. And, uh, we'll be live soon. And, uh, the audience, uh, keep liking our podcast and, uh, Spotify, apple Podcast and everywhere we York. Uh, and stay tuned. Thank you so much.

Apart from his professional achievements, Marco is committed to serving his family, church and the community. He has held leadership, leadership positions in various organizations in his hometown area, and is always excited to see young people getting involved in the insurance industry.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>So sit back, relax and listen in as we chat with Marco about his journey and insights into the ever-changing world of insurance. Welcome Marco.</p><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Marco Warner:</b> Thank you. That was very flattering. I appreciate that very much. And I was one of the founding members of TrustPoint. , so my, uh, business partner, Bob aka, was a key part of that as well.</div><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>And we have really been, uh, just excited to see the transformation that our organization has taken place over the last few years.</p><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Amazing. Amazing. So as we, we are talking about it, you know, the partners and how it all started. So can you tell us a bit about your background and how you got started in your current role?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Marco Warner:</b> Well, my wife hates it when I start out with I, when I was born, right? So we'll kind of skip that part. But I grew up in a small town in southwest Virginia and my grandfather was in the insurance business and my grandfather always said that I was the only person that he ever knew that said he was gonna grow up to be an insurance salesman.</div><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>So, you know, we don't hear that very often, uh, out there, but, I got outta high school. I went to Virginia Tech. Um, I married my wife while I was still there and I came back to, well, she and I came back to Richlands and we have never looked back. And, um, this business has been so good to me. I learned, you know, out of a phone book on how to sell insurance and that that's not fun.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Um, I did these little things to reward myself for, you know, making x number of calls a day and didn't have a whole lot of training or anything, you know, basically, here, here's the phone book, go sell. Well, what am I selling? You know, that, that's a hard thing to overcome. So, so my success took a little longer than going to work for a large organization where you had that kind of formal training, but I had the best experience because I had a grandfather who was one of the wisest and smartest men that I ever knew. Teach me some of the ropes. Uh, so that's how I got started. Uh, we were a personal lines agency at the time and when I came to the agency, my mother was working here as well, and we, we were writing a few small.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Uh, what we call truck mines, uh, coal mines in southwest Virginia, Southern or Southern West Virginia and Eastern Kentucky. And, and so I really got a, uh, I really went out. Caught on a lot of those mines, rode a lot of truck mines. Got in, you know, deeply involved in the coal business at the time, writing insurance for them.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Uh, met a few really good lawyers and a few people that took me under their wing and helped me develop some business acumen. Uh, and help me understand, uh, con. Contractual transfer of risk. And I appreciate those, those people a lot and how they helped me through my career and my mother, and I bought the agency.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>And then in 90, um, uh, Right after we bought the agency, uh, the coal market collapsed and a lot of our business went out the door. Not because we lost at the competition, but just because it was gone. And it taught me a very valuable lesson at that time. And unfortunately, My mother and I had to sell the agency so that we could pay my grandfather back.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>And I went to work for a publicly traded company. I learned a lot, you know, there as well about how to manage an agency. I was a profit centre manager for this small agency in Richlands, and I learned about the economic. Of an agency and, uh, things to look for, things to kind of overcome the simplification that my grandfather had given me.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Not, not that it wasn't great information, but, you know, he was always, well, you know, granddaddy we're a little behind this month. He said, well, you can always fix it by just selling more, you know, and, and that's a great approach and it's true, right? But you know, there's some other things you need to apply to.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>To the industry as well. Uh, so sold to, uh, this company. Uh, They came out with this thing where they wanted all their offices to be 40% operating profit. We, we really valued what we did for our customers and it was gonna make it very difficult for us to do that in a smaller office like we had. And we got a new regional manager, and I think he was going through a crisis of conscious at the time.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>And so he went to them and asked him if he could purchase these offices in southwest Virginia. Called me, asked me to, to join him. And I said, okay, but you know here's a few things that I have to have and, uh, haven't regretted it one bit. And we started Trust Point in 2006. We floundered around a little while.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Uh, we were. Making money. We were not working all that hard. And, um, we had gotten back into the energy business again with the coaled methane extraction business you know, pipeline business, basically, uh, pipeline construction, uh, drilling. Um, that sort of thing and then that market collapsed again in 2016.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>And, and it was a moment at time, which you had to decide. Am I gonna sell or am I gonna change what I'm doing? And it was a really an unbelievable wake up call for us. And, you know, we knew we were doing a lot of the right things. We had, we, we had embraced technology. We were doing, we were ahead of the curve in all of that, in our opinion. even from where we came from. You know, we, we were, we. Better skill set at utilizing technology in the sales process. And so we buckled down, uh, we made a plan, uh, we changed some things that we were doing and we've never looked back. And I mean, from that time we've grown significantly. And, and there was a little bit of acquisition, but you know, mainly organic growth and we seem to be good at what we do, and our customers, you know, tell us that they like us. So, uh, we're having a good time and I love it. And I'd like to say one more thing, KB before I end this part, um, for, you know, This business can give you anything that you're looking for. I mean, you take somebody like me, I've never had to leave my community.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>I've never had to leave my family except for some travel. But I've been able to do it from a small town of 4,500 people and I've sat in the office tower buildings and presented presentations to boards of directors and, and I've flown to a different spot and sat on, you know, The tracks of a dozer and did a million dollar deal.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>And I mean, this business is just so unbelievable for somebody that embraces it. So in a way, there are no limitations.</p><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> You are the only limit. None if you're you, you cross by yourself, you can achieve anything. And, uh, absolutely your grandfather sounds like, you know, very knowledgeable and interesting person.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>And I like the, the thought of, you know, if you are, you're falling behind. Just get more. And it's the simplest thing what that's right, can do. And you also talked about self reward, which, which I loved actually. And I could recall, uh, one quotation.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>On this, it says, uh, reward yourself not just for your achievements, but for your efforts and perseverance. Celebrate not just your success, but also your growth and progress. Remember, that is absolutely a true reward is in the journey and not just a destination.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Marco Warner:</b> And, and it doesn't have to be huge either, you know, simplify it. It, I mean, for me, it w I loved coffee and I would have my cup of coffee in the morning and I couldn't have my next cup of coffee until I did X number of calls. I mean, simple things like that to motivate yourself to do the things that you don't really want to do.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Absolutely. Absolutely. All right so you know this one is a fun one. If you could ensure any frictional, character. Who would it be and why?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Marco Warner:</b> That's an easy one. Wiley Coyote, and some people may not know who that is, but Wiley Coyote and the Acme Company, so going back to my grandfather, he always said, write the things that are the hardest to write, that are the most difficult that nobody else wants, because that's where the most premium's gonna be and with more premium comes more commission. So just think about how difficult it would be to write life insurance on Wally Cote and ensure the Acme Company.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Wow. Great. So, uh, You know, talking about today's world as they say, it's a soft world. And, uh, then there are lots of, uh, not, not soft world, but the market is soft right now, but there are still lots of technological changes in advancement in the industry as well. So what do you think are the biggest challenges facing the insurance industry today and how do you see them being interest in the future?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Marco Warner:</b> Well, um, I've, I've given this question a lot of thoughts since you sent it to me, and it is, uh, I don't know that you can a, an address all of the challenges that are facing just from a technology perspective, uh, because I think some of the things that we are facing right now in our industry in general, not just the retail side, but the carrier side as well.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>We're facing an aging workforce and most of the best knowledge is in those people that are, most of the best coverage knowledge is in that, uh, that age group that is exiting the business here in the very near future. Uh, and, and that makes it difficult because we have to replace them and, and another challenge we face because of that, our brand as an industry is not that great. There, you know, there's not a lot of children growing up saying, oh, I want to be in the insurance industry. True. And the thing is, when people think about it, I think they think about that person down the street, selling home in auto. And, and I love those folks and there's nothing wrong with that, but that's just a small part, of this industry.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Uh, and I'll give you a really good example of that. Um, so one of the young men in our company. Uh, was a contractor and he recently went to work for one of the insurance companies as an adjuster, and he had no desire to be in the insurance industry, and it just sort of fell in his lap. But he now adjusts all of the claims for a specific insurance company in, in Southwest Virginia, eastern Tennessee, and Southern West Virginia.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>He's making more money. Than he was before and he's got better hours and he's got a robust benefit package. And yeah, and I'm just so happy for him and, and. To think about that type of job, you know, that that's out there. But, but going back to your question you know, in addition to the, to our brand as an industry and what, you know, how young people perceive it, as well as the aging workforce, emerging risk is also something that is we're gonna have to deal with as an industry.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>I mean, there's things out there right now that scare the fire out of me, but, you know, you just have to, uh, buckle down and have conversations with people about how are we gonna handle this? And I'll give you a quick example of that. , see in cyber liability, something I never thought about contingent business interruption.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>That you purchase under that we're seeing the carriers now limit that because of a catastrophic event that might, you know, disrupt the, you know, the entire cyber insurance world. And, and so they're wanting to put sub limits on that and, and we didn't even think about that a few years back. Right. I mean, that's not something that was talked about at all.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>So I think emerging risk, social unrest. I mean, how are we gonna deal with some of these things that are happening in the cities from an underwriting perspective to be able to ensure that businessperson for an amount of money that they can afford, you know, within their budget. And then in addition to that social inflation, you know, we're seeing a lot of verdicts happening.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Those, uh, in, you know, moving upward in that trend across the industry is, uh, is creating a lot of havoc among the, uh, Actuaries in the, in the insurance industry. And, and then, uh, from a retail perspective, from our side, I think we have the aging ownership. Uh, but, but one of the things I think that is a huge challenge for us is we have a lot of people coming into the industry without any business acumen.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>and it's a very difficult thing to teach, right? Especially to someone who hasn't sat in an owner's seat, uh, or in a CFO position or, or one of those positions. and it's, and how do people get that, right? How do they develop that? And do you have the patience, To allow them, you know, to get there?</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Um, and then, uh, I think because the insurance industry is lagged behind, The rest of the world from a technology perspective. I think if you are a retail agent out there, you need to figure out how to apply your own technology and overcome some of the things you know that are missing from the people who you are selling product for.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Um, Buyer awareness, I think is another big deal. I think buyers are becoming so aware of what's out there, you know, that that buddy-buddy system is no longer going to prevail. Yeah. That people are looking for some way to make this process simpler and easier and have a, a greater ability to understand how it's applicable to their business as an example.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>That's something that I talk about a lot, you know, with my sales team is put yourself in their seat.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Right, right. Fantastic. And I can totally relate to a lot of these things and in fact, the other day I was meeting with one of, uh, our partners and we were discussing that, you know, Aging workforce is one of the biggest challenges, and the other associated part to it is when the most experienced of the workforce is leaving the industry, there would be avoid in a vacuum soon because there is no one apt.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>To train the, the, the new joiners to the industry. Even if you see, uh, as, as, uh, you know, if you wanna go to some traditional institute or something that train you on the insurance world, there are very limited resources out there. Just one or two. So you know, and I'm talking way ahead of the time but I just feel like, sharing this with you.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>So we are already in discussion, in planning to launch such a place where we can train the, the, the new generation within the insurance domain, uh, irrespective of what part they want to go into. But yes, we want to launch a, an online academy sort of thing where we would be providing. The, the workflow information the basics of the industry and you know how to go about sales, how to go about servicing and what not.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Marco Warner:</b> Yeah, I, you know, and I've got mixed thoughts. I mean, we could spend an entire session on this, uh, because, you know, the part of me says we don't have to teach them anything about insurance. We need to teach them about the buying experience. And what that looks like.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>And then you hear people who. And that work for a larger agency says, well, that doesn't work when you begin to play upstream from where you are. Well, the fact is, it does because we take accounts from the larger brokers all the time simply because they're not doing the things that need to be done. Uh, but then on the other hand, you really need to figure out how to teach them technical skills in a shorter period of time.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>And, and these. Folks learned so in, in such a different way than you, than I did. I'm not gonna throw you in the that way, but, but the way that I did and, uh, I learned through experience and. That, that's just unacceptable nowadays because it takes so much longer, you know, for you to ramp up and become, you know, truly effective in this business than if you gain that knowledge the way you have it.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>So we're gonna have to figure out how to do it from a phone, I think right.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Absolutely. So we, we touched base technology a little bit. Let's talk more about it. So how has technology impacted the insurance industry? What new technologies do you see having the greatest impact in the years to come?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Marco Warner:</b> Well, obviously the carriers are having difficulty with this, right? I mean, yeah. They have so, so much information and it's so massive, you know, being able. Turn the direction of that ship takes significantly longer, you know, than, than, uh, more agile and younger, you know, industries do. So it's harder for them, uh, for us on the retail side. It's a matter of, you know, can we make our customer experience better by the utilization of it?</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>And, and I'll give you you know, one of my examples that I give so I got frustrated because uh, I've been going to the same. Doctor for years, right. And every time I went, had to fill out the same form. I mean, they asked me my name, they asked me my date of birth. You know, those things are not gonna change.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>KB they're the same every single time I go in there. Right. And, and, and then there's four or five forms you have to fill out and, um, I was really frustrated, uh, about that. And as my life changed and I got a little busier, it, it became even more frustrating for me. And so I thought about that and how our customers feel about how we transact that bi business with them on a day-to-day basis.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>We send them a supplemental application. And they fill it out. And they do that year over year, over year. And just a simple thing like adopting a program like Indio, uh, and we were early adopters of that and we figured out ways to kind of enhance the way we utilize that and, and being able to send that to someone and completely change how they deliver that renewal information back to us, changes the experience that they have. and that's a very simple part of it, but it's something that there's so many things out there that we can utilize to, to be able to change the lives of the people we deal with on a day-to-day basis. And we need to embrace that.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Absolutely. Uh, I have been to, uh, these conferences recently.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>One was Insure Tech and the other one was, uh, innovation in AI in insurance. And everyone was talking about Chat GPT and how AI is taking shape and how it can impact the professions and lives of everyone. Involve across the industries, not just insurance. And I was thinking in my mind talking about technology is great.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>However, I feel the adoption of technology is not that, that great in, in the insurance industry. And, and uh, you know, that's something everyone should be discussing on how to adopt those technologies to make ourselves you know, competitive to the, the other industries, you know, relating to your point, the, the.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>The insurance industry is a brand. It's not there. It's, and one of the reasons is it's, it's not pacing up with other industries. It's not as lucrative. It doesn't sound as lucrative as other industries. So I think we should be talking a lot about how to, to be more agile and adoptive and receptive towards these, uh, technologies.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Well, uh, great. So, you know, uh, we, we are, we, we are talking about young guys who would be joining the industry or who may want to join industry. you know, what do you think are the most important qualities for someone working in insurance and how they can develop those qualities?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Marco Warner:</b> So, I think in general, Uh, you, you can have whatever quality you want and the, there's a place for you in this industry. I gave you an example earlier. I mean, you know, I never would've thought of that, right? But I, I think we, I, I think from the standpoint of the retail side, it's different. Obviously if you're selling something, you have to have, you know, certain qualities in order to be successful. but in general if you, if you want to help people in typically the most dire time of their life when they, when they have a claim, and prepare them for that on the front end, there's no limit.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>To what you can do. I mean, you can be basically a hermit and still find a creative job in this industry. So from that aspect, I, I don't know that there's any one just to join the industry. Uh, that, that's out there. From the retail side though, I think it's a little different. I mean, you, it's forward facing and I, and I think that on the retail side, especially on the sales side, which is obviously what I can speak to the most is you, you cannot have call reluctance.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>You have to have a willingness to be able to pick up that phone and to call. Anybody Right. To sell them insurance. Now I say that, but I mean, we have a whole, you know, kind of idea about how we approach it. But, but the call reluctance is something that you cannot have, right? Uh, and, uh, and a lot of times you can test out, uh, in a, a personality profile, for example, and, and check all the right box.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>But yet that steel is there for someone and it doesn't, it, it doesn't, um, uh, it doesn't perform well on the retail sales side part of it. So call reluctance is a big one. And as I was thinking about the question when you sent it to me, you know, you got to have a belief in what you're. You, you have to know that it's going to help someone that, that what the way that you're doing it and the way that you're going about it, uh, is better than anybody else out there, and that you have the resources and the team and all of that behind you.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>And I've seen people that could call anyone, but yet they didn't have that belief. And therefore they weren't successful in this business. So I think those two things are very important from the sales side of it.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Amazing And I, I'll extend this question a bit. Uh, say, I think we already touched upon it, but if we have to particularly talk about what, you know, what do you think sets successful insurance professionals apart from those who struggle to succeed?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Marco Warner:</b> Again, I think it is getting in front of people, limited pipeline. That's something that is critical is having that pipeline full constantly. Uh, and I think that, uh, from the standpoint of what makes people truly successful in this business, and, uh, the ones that kind of, you know, you have average, right?</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>And then you've got a little above average, and then you have great, let, let's talk about it from a million dollar producer perspective. I'll give you a few things that this is a Marcoism, as some of my team members will call, call on me, but, but I think that you have to have a Rolodex and you have to understand how to utilize that Rolodex for the benefit of everybody that's out there that you're doing business.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Now I can kind of expand on that. And, and if, and if, for those listeners that don't know what a Rolodex is, that's a contact list. All right. That's your contact list in your phone. And so this was something that my grandfather taught me early was how to make connections with people. And when you, when you can figure out, It's, it's not just about the selling of insurance that makes those people great.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>It's, how they utilize everything around them for the benefit of the people that are there. You know, my, I my grandfather was a huge Stephen Covey fan. He always says, you know, you help, uh, people get what they want. They'll help you get what you want And that's, that's what I'm talking about. So you're sitting in a sales meeting, you ask, well, tell me what's on your mind today.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>And they say something completely different than insurance. But you have a resource in that Rolodex, and if you can pull that out your mind and go find it, you can, you can solve that problem for someone. Yeah. So, um, I, I think that those connections, we, we, we talk about them in fancy words and all of that, but the fact is it's as simple as being able to.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Absolutely, and I think networking and relationship is key to everything, be it business, your personal life, and everything.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Fantastic. Uh, so, you know, uh, I understand there are not so many changes in the industry, but you know, the, the operating procedures, the technology is still there. So how do you stay up to date with the latest trends and developments in the insurance industry, and what resources do you recommend for others who want to do the same.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Marco Warner:</b> So I do a, a daily devotion. I have a friend that has emailed me a daily devotion every year, e every day for 20 years. It's amazing. I mean, it is absolutely amazing. he gets up really early. He does his, he sends it to a, a group of, of us folks that are on his email list. And after I'm done with that, I do what I call my insurance devotion, right?</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>You have to spend some portion of a day, uh, reading up on what's going on, you know, the latest trends, that sort of thing. I, I, I make sure that it's, it's not all about insurance and risk management, but also it, part of it is, uh, about what's happening out there. In business, right? In general, uh, because it's, you need to keep up with that as well.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>What are, what are people facing that are sitting on the other side of the table that you're talking with? Um, what are some of those things that are going on? So, so I make sure that I do that. Insurance devotion every single day. Uh, in addition to that, a lot of my, uh, friends and family know that I love podcasts and when I'm, when I'm in the car and I've got that windshield time, I listen to podcasts mostly around topics other than insurance.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>I really like to listen to technology related things, people talking about disruptors, you know, how they're changing this industry or that industry and like, oh my gosh, why didn't I think of that? You know I'm fascinated by it. And the other thing that, that it does for me is it helps keep me sharp at thinking about what can we do in our industry to be ahead of the curve.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Fantastic. Let's touch base on risk management for a while. How do you approach risk management in your work and what advice do you have for others who are looking to improve their risk management skills?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Marco Warner:</b> I say start with the basics. Right. Start with the basics. Understand how to transfer risk, how to avoid risk, how to either retain risk or not. Risk retention, uh, and then how to prevent risk. And then once you have an understanding of the basics of that, here is one of the things that my grandfather and my mother made me do in the insurance industry.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>And I think it is so true today for people that are wanting to learn how things work. Find someone that you know That will allow you to come to their business and spend a couple of days, especially in a high hazard type environment where they're dealing with it on a day-to-day basis. Keep your mouth shut take notes. And, and learn what it is that person deals with from a true business perspective. after that, take 'me out to dinner. Buy their dinner, uh, for doing that for you. And also, you know, take a day or two, come back to that person with questions cantered around those four things. Right that they, they may have missed or whatever.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>It, it will give you a time to, you know, kind of think about it. Uh, I did this when I was first starting out in my career. I went out and I spent two days with a guy that owned a surface mining operation. And it was amazing. Uh, just the things that they deal with on a day to day. I saw things that I'm like, oh my gosh, I can't believe they're doing that.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>You know, so, well, how do you, you know, how do you keep that. Excavator from falling over the side of the mountain or that, you know, that type of thing. But, uh, um, but, but it is, it sounds simple, but if you can find that person that will allow you to do that, you will learn more in those two days than you can out of a textbook.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Amazing. So, from the sounds of it, you know, but you keep busy with business and traveling, and you did also mention that somehow you keep that balance, and you still can provide time to your, your family, your friends, uh, your community. So how do you balance your commitments? Personal life to your work, to community. And again, you know, how, how, what suggestions or advice do you want to give to others who are trying to do so, or they are struggling to have a balance?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Marco Warner:</b> Well, KB I'm not perfect. You can ask my wife and she will tell you. So I don't have all of the answers. Um, but having said that I would tell you that I kind of failed at it, you know, early in my career I mentioned that the coal market collapsed.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Yeah. You know, I went out and started writing assisted living facilities. You know, there wasn't one in Richlands, Virginia, so I had to travel a lot. Uh, I had to make up for that loss and, and I took away from my family. Um, but my father-in-law, you know, he was my kind of my accountability partner at the time, right?</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>He would make me write out these goals and stuff, and then he would challenge me on how I was doing. Uh, and we've applied that same thing to. To, to how we conduct ourselves in, in our business. So we do this thing with all of our producers and we tell them that, you know, they're Marco Warner.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Incorporated or LLC, and they operate under this enterprise, right? So they need to write a business plan, you know, for Marco Warner, LLC and then they need to set professional goals. They need to set personal goals, they need to set family goals, they need to set health goals, and they need to.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Spiritual goals and they need to write them out, and then they need to find that accountability partner and on a regular basis, they need to get with that person and they need to, uh, do this little exercise that we recommend, you know, uh, Am I, am I on track for my goal in each of those categories? And if not, why?</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>And if I am, do I need to readjust my goal and be, and be deliberate about it? Uh, and then it's up to us as leaders to recognize when they're struggling with, uh, one s. Specifically their professional goal. But you know, when you see somebody that you know, you can tell if you're a you know if you're around that person life, you can tell if things aren't going well and just be human and, you know, say, Hey, what's going on?</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>You know, uh, you know. You seem like you're a little distracted. Is there anything we can do? Uh, have you met with your accountability partner? And that way we're staying out of it. Right? You met with your accountability partner, uh, and talked through those things, so that's my advice to people.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Amazing. Now, something lighter, something, on the other part of you. So, uh, you know, uh, we came to know that you are ever, fisherman in fact based fisherman. So can you share with us your favourite fishing spot and what you love about this sport?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Marco Warner:</b> Well, you know, all my friends would tell me to say my favourite fishing spot is in the water. Right. But, um, my, my favourite place to fish is Smith Mountain Lake right outside of Roanoke, Virginia.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Uh, it is a beautiful lake. Uh, my wife and I have a. A place up there and, um, I bass fish there regularly. My favourite time of the year to fish is from about April the 15th to about July the 4th. That's when the shad spawn is on up there. We do a lot of night fishing and we, uh, we use top water bates and it is exciting to catch six- or seven-pound largemouth bass on top water. Um, so yeah, and I'm a competitive person, so I do a lot of tournaments and I fish a lot of rodeos and then I fish a series or two, you know, against people who are better than me, uh, because that only makes you better, right?</div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Wow. And I promise, this is my last one say. So what's the funniest insurance claim you have ever seen?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Marco Warner:</b> The funniest insurance thing. I tell this story all the time. One of my customers called me up one day and he said, Hey, Marco if someone cut a tree down and it falls in their house, is that covered? And I said, yes, stupidity is covered. And he said, oh, thank God I got a tree sitting in my living room.</p><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'>Think I have a few that I can't tell on this podcast, but people can call me and I'll tell 'me, you know, over the telephone.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Thank you so much, Marco.

Get ready for a witty ride to the fascinating world of insurance and insurtech with our incredible guest, Bryan Falchuk. Welcome Bryan, how are you? </div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> Thank you very much for having me on KB. I'm doing really well. </div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Amazing, amazing. So, Bryan, can you tell us a bit about your professional journey and how you have transitioned from the insurance industry to become an author, speaker, and coach?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> So, it was muddy, I would say the transition, but my time in insurance is I think how a lot of people get into insurance, which is by accident. Very few people plan to get into it. Maybe their parents were agents or something like that. But, um, you know, no different for me. I was doing business strategy work, and I found a role at a carrier doing that. Um, and what I found is it's actually really exciting. There's I like making things better. I like seizing opportunity. And there's a lot of that to do in insurance because we typically are behind other industries, you know, we move slower. And I wanted to find ways to do that better. Um, and that's what my career has been about. And I was lucky to get exposure to different lines of business and functions along the way, different carriers. I spent time at a consulting company called McKinsey, working for, you know, other carriers as well. So, I saw even more, just honestly, a really lucky ride in lots of different contexts and issues and experiences. And that, uh, sort of came together in the work that I do today, which is. You know, bit by bit, as I was still working at a carrier, I started to work on some books to try to help people overcome what they face and wanted to do the same for the insurance industry. And that's how I got into the coaching, the speaking, the book writing. It just sorts of happened organically, almost as if I didn't have a choice. I saw these paths to making things better. I was getting to see people's firsthand stories of, you know, companies that needed to overcome something and they did. And you know, I think that's worth sharing. So that's what I've been trying to do the past few years. </div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Amazing then that's fascinating to hear and I'm sure besides the ups and downs, it must be a thrilling journey so far </p> </div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> It is. And I think, you know, when we go to conferences or when people share publicly, often you only hear about the ups, right? They're giving a very sanitized story and that's fine. And I think we should have positivity and all that. But the reality is we need balance. We need honesty in the tough moments we face and what we did to come through them. And I always say the fact that you're still standing here today is evidence that you got through it as hard as it was. What can we learn from that journey? And so, we need those honest stories of the ups and the downs and, you know, hindsight, what would you have done differently? What did you do in those moments to turn it around? That's the kind of stuff we need to share with each other to figure out a better way to do things.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> couldn't agree more. And talking about learning, your other bestselling book, Do a Day, has helped countless people make lasting changes in their lives. Can you share the inspiration behind writing this book and the core message that you want readers and our listeners to take away?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> So Do a Day was my first book, and it's based on my own journey and story. I have a background of a lot of anxiety and obesity, and the two were very intertwined. And it came to a head that I lost weight, put it back on. But then my wife, when we were just starting our family out, became gravely ill. Her doctors called me to tell me there's nothing else to be done, and that was it. And so here I am. thinking about or at a point in our lives where we would have been thinking about building a family and instead, I'm now looking at being a single father all of a sudden. Not something you expect, right? And she is still alive today, but I remember getting that call from her doctor when I was told the opposite was about to happen. And that was this massive wake-up call to me to finally address the things that were standing in my way. And really at the time, it was about being a better father to this kid who was watching his mother fade away. In hopes of him having a brighter future than was being set up for him. That was enough motivation at the time. What it's become for me is not any less about him, but I wasn't ready to value myself in that equation to understand why I would want to be better for me. Why did I even deserve that? And that's what evolution was. So, from that starting point of having a real purpose, at the time my son, and it's bigger than that for me now. what needs to change in my life. And this is true of business too. We look at these things as mountains, right? And you don't climb to the mountain, to the top of a mountain in one step. And that's the notion of Do a Day is, you look ahead, you know, I had a hundred pounds to lose. That is too much weight to lose at any given time. And there's people who've had more than that. I will tell you as a fact, you look at that and you shut down, right? No one </p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Yes.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> looks at that. level of mountain and says like, okay, I can do this because it's a long process. It's very hard. You work your blooks at that. level of mountain and says like, okay, I can do this because it's a long process. It's very hard. You work your butt off, and you feel like you're making no progress because maybe the scale moved a pound or two. It's still a mountain ahead of you. But the thing is you're not losing all that weight today.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Yes.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> You're not, you know, changing your systems and digitizing this massive organization. It's so difficult and migrating your data today. Today you have actions you have to take that move you towards that. that summit, you know, you're, you're walking along that path, and you may veer off the path at times, you may trip and fall and that's okay. Progress does not have to be a straight and direct line. So, Do a Day is really the kind of thinking behind that mentality of how do we have these goals and change our life? What drives us to do that? And how do we structure it in a way that we don't get discouraged because it's so overwhelming that we don't even start, or we shut down once we do. And that's what I had struggled with my whole life. That was 2011, when I got that phone call from that doctor. Here we are this month, sorry, next month, June, will be the 12th year reunion, like anniversary of that call, if you will. Nothing's changed for me since then. I have been on this path, and I've achieved so many great things. I have not gone back. And what's so important is that's how I know it works. And I actually. apply that same mentality in business. It's not just a self-help kind of thing. It's a way to live your life, to lead people, to execute holistically.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Oh, absolutely. This is an inspiring story and reminds me of a line. So, I've seen most of the movies from Sylvester Stallone and </p> </div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> Okay.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> There was one movie, John Rambo, I guess, and this part, he was leaving the town at the end of the movie and the sheriff asked him, how are you going to live the rest of your life? And his answer is still very fresh with me. It's like day by day. And I think that's the most beautiful answer you can give to such a question. So I think Do a Day is like, you know, it totally relates and it totally makes sense because there's another theory, you know, called if you, if your task involves eating a frog, do that first thing in the morning so that at least you have, you have started and you have done the toughest thing, the first thing in the morning. So, thank you for such an insight. And so, your coaching practice. It focuses on both life and executive coaching. What are some common challenges you see your clients facing? And how do you help them navigate these situations?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'> <b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> Yeah. Well, it's funny that people don't understand the interplay of the two and I don't understand the separation of them. And I think if we're honest with ourselves, if you have a tough day at the office, it's not like you walk back into your house at the end of the day and walking through that door somehow washes you of all of that difficulty and you're this wonderful, easygoing, happy person, even if only a piece of you, you're carrying that pain with you and vice versa. If you're struggling at home... If you're honest with yourself, it's showing up at work as well. And I know for many of us now, home and work are in the same place. So maybe it's not technically walking in the door again, but </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'> <b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Right. </p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> We are complex intertwined beings. We don't have these as much as we may try to, we don't have these silos of ourselves. So, to me, it's one in the same. And that means I don't think you can work on your abilities as a leader, as an executive, uh, as a guide to other people in their lives and for your own success. if you're also not working on who you are as a human being. And I do think we have to bring both together. And so, the things I end up working on with people are often exactly the same, whether they've come to me about like, oh, I need to lose weight, or my finances, personal finances are a mess, and I can't get myself on that side of it. Or I have this great opportunity at work, I don't know if I'm ready for it, or I want to move ahead and I'm not getting that kind of support, what do I need to do? Or should I leave my job and... all those issues, it's not that I don't care what your issue is, it's that it's almost irrelevant in terms of what we should do about it, because it ultimately comes back to what is what drives you. So, we have to get back to </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Right.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> sort of a first principles of value standpoint, what matters to you above all else? What are your non-negotiables? And then we have to craft something around that. So, you know, when you're facing those tough moments. Uh, you need to dig deep, right? And you need to know what it is you're digging for that will carry you through when someone's attacking you and challenging you or being difficult or not siding with you in a, you know, a debate about something, or you're not getting the funding that you need and one of your peers is getting all the staff they need and you get none, how do you get through that? Not, not just negotiating for a better outcome, but how do you then operate in a way that doesn't get you fired because you're worked up about it? And that, you know, that, that takes knowing how you personally navigate what you're facing to remembering what matters and it may mean you need to leave. It may mean you need to go about things differently or maybe you're wrong in the first place and there's a reason why that person got those resources and if you really separate yourself from the personal attack, you felt or the loss you felt could you see it through another lens like the lens of the organization. There's you know all kinds of different ways to navigate it, but it starts from that place of understanding what truly matters to you. And then you have to execute against that and not, you know, not from some other place or just, you know, people say like, it's Do a Day, grin and bear it. But it's just like, you know, buckle down and deal with</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> happen.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> The tough time and it will pass. Well, the problem with </p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'> <b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Right. </p></div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> Life is when I hear people like, I just need to get through this and then it'll be fine. It's like, really? There's nothing else you're ever going to face in your life. That's not reality.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Right.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'> <b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> So, we need the tools to live as ourselves rather than thinking if I just, you know, close my eyes and hold my breath and wait. then I'll be okay. That's not the way things work. You need to be more engaged and know what you're engaging from.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Absolutely. And I also feel, you know, when they say it will pass, but it won't pass on its own. You </p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> Right.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Cannot just play victim for a while and then you'll be happy go lucky guy. You have to do something about it to change the situation, be it your life or business. Couldn't agree more on this. So yeah, that's something to keep a note of every day.

Not just a day. You have to do something for that progress. Just sit on a conveyor belt and move ahead.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Yeah, you gotta be the driver, absolutely. Absolutely. Great, so yeah, now talking about some insurance things. So, you have spent a lot of time in the industry and as a seasoned insurance professional, what do you see as the most significant challenges currently facing the industry and how these can be addressed?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> So, I think we have a number of macroeconomic factors that are really coming down on the industry, making it difficult. And I think we have internal factors as well. The macro factors, we will always have macro factors. They may change over time. The internal factors have been with us for a very long time, and they tend to be the same ones. On the macro side, there's a lot of cost-related pressures out there, the cost of insurance. So, there are a lot of natural catastrophes going on that the environment is extremely unstable. People hear global warming and then it's cold out and they're like, oh, see, it's a lie. No, that's not global warming, it doesn't just mean it's getting hotter. That is a piece of it. It's also the instability and weather patterns, which drives more storm activity, which drives volcanoes and earthquakes and all of it. And when you look at the data, it's extremely clear. No question. That is where we're at. And that creates a lot of just fundamental problems in insurance. That's a huge one. There's a lot of inflation globally. That's another macroeconomic problem that is profound for insurance on a number of fronts. And there's a lot of political unrest and instability and extremism, a lot of extreme partisanship and extreme views, which brings some problems on the law side, but it also, what you see is it infects societies. So, we have a lot of hatred and blame within societies. I mean, look, I live in the US. We're a very litigious society anyway. But the nature of litigation has changed. It's no longer, this person was hurt, we feel so bad for them. Don't they, they need money to survive, and they should be paid for their pain and suffering. There's a piece of that now, but instead it's that plus, and these people hurt them and they're terrible and they're evil and they're trying to kill us all and we need to punish them, and you need to send them. It's like a political ad. It's about getting a jury to be angry and hate someone rather than playing on their emotions to feel bad for someone who has been hurt. And that's a very dangerous difference. And you see that in the outcomes, the dollars are significantly larger. That's another macroeconomic issue. That is, it's a societal issue. And frankly, it's really unenjoyable to live in a society where so many people hate each other and villainize each other. And I wish that that would stop. Putting aside the insurance, I don't want my family growing up in that.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Yes. </p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> And I don't know how to escape it because it seems to be spreading. We need to do something; we have to do something to change that. That is a choice we all need to make.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Oh, absolutely. And it made me think, you know, when we say great America, what made America great was the, the, the inclusion, you</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> Yeah.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> know, the feeling of inclusion, you</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> Yeah.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> know, welcoming everyone and being, you know, part of the society and not just</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> Understanding,</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> An individual</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> Supporting.</p></div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> or a race or a community, but you know, together as one force, one nation becomes a bigger force.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> Yeah.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> But I think we are losing on that as a, it's a global problem.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'> <b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> Yeah.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> It's</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> It is.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Not just America.

And of course, if something happens in society, businesses cannot get unaffected. So, it's going to cast a shadow on this.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> Yes.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> And talking about that, just that name came to my mind. Instead of global warming, I think more relatable is like global weather disruption.

Thank you. Now, talking about digital transformation, the insurance industry has experienced significant digital transformation. in recent years. However,</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> Yes.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Tech adoption is still slow overall within the industry. What future trends do you foresee in the insurance tech space?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> So, we had a forcing moment in COVID because insurance has things that must happen. We can't just close for two weeks. If someone has a claim, we have to, by regulation, we have to be there to respond. And the good side of that is it did force a lot of change that needed to happen, and it made it happen faster. What I hope it showed us is we can get a lot of things done in much less time. and in much less painful ways than we said they must take. You know, I saw companies talking about multi-year remote work enablement. And of course, they did it within days. It's like, wait, you just said it would take</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Umm</p> </div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> A year</p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Sorry</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> And a half and you did it in two days, how is, how is the year and a half, right? What can we look at to change the way we're scoping these things? So I would love to see that as a path forward. I'm not so sure that's going to stick. Unfortunately, I've already seen a reversion back to slower. And it was too fast, and it was too erratic because it had to be. But that doesn't mean we have to go back to the way it was. What I do see in the near term is more of a shift to the cloud for the core operating systems of carriers, which then brings with it, it comes with friends. And the friends are APIs, microservices, an easier ability to connect different systems, microservices, data, uh, whether it's data sources. data storage, data analysis tools, AI, etc., all of that can be so much more easily enabled once you're on the cloud. And it's a momentum story. So, you get on the cloud, you start working with APIs, your people get better at working with them. The ball starts rolling in the right direction. It's a virtuous cycle. So that's one thing. And I've seen a lot of progress on that. There's still much more to be had. And I still today see carriers making core system decisions. on premises because they say the cost of the cloud is too much. But everything you're going to spend now, which is huge and more than you think it will be, and we still haven't learned this lesson. We scope 50 million and spend 280, and yet we still scope 50 the next time. We have to learn that lesson. We are throwing vast amounts of resources away, reinforcing the wrong answer for how we should be enabling our future. So... I would love to see that conversation move forward more rapidly than it is, but I appreciate the progress that's been made. Where I think that goes is more interconnectivity. You hear the word embedded insurance. It's a bit of a buzzword, but it really isn't. It is a real tangible thing. And I think we're in the very early days of that. No one wants to buy insurance generally. They want to buy the thing that had to get insured or have the experience that you</p> </div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Right.</p> </div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> Need the insurance for. How do we make the protection of that thing? more seamless. There are all kinds of things going on with that. There's other enablement, IOT, connected cars, all kinds of other things brewing that when you look at those and you look at embedded, you see this really holistic story of not just a better buying experience, but less risk, more ability to control it. And, you know, we talk about the weather patterns, risks are becoming uninsurable, either on the whole or because the price of insuring it is not sustainable, no one can pay it. Some of these stories start to affect the insurability or the rate because we have other mechanisms at play that can help control it. We have to be open to looking at some of these things and embedded in me is one piece of that puzzle. So, I'm very excited by the conversations going around that as one example.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Absolutely. And I only wish, because I see lots of talks going on about it, but I want to see a lot of actions as well alongside, which is lacking a bit right now. But I'm happy at least we're talking about it, because it feels like things will change soon. Let's hope and</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> Yes.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> wait for that day. Cool. Now, we were talking about customer experience. Customer experience has become a crucial aspect of the insurance industry. Can you share your thoughts on how insurance companies can improve their customer engagement and satisfaction?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> Yeah, and you know, I have seen a lot of progress here, and I've seen a lot of folks who give themselves credit for progress, but I'm not sure that they've made it. And I think the real differentiator in this is whether you're hearing it from your customers or not. And I would include your staff in that, the people on the front lines that are engaging with the customers, using your systems, even if it's not a customer facing system, if your people who are serving your customers are using it. The net effect is its customer facing. And so, what's their experience and what are they hearing? My own experience in the carrier space is there was a lot of sorts of telling the customers what it is they want or just speaking on their behalf. And even when you would see survey results that don't align with what you're saying, I saw something that a carrier was building the third most wanted thing in this list of 10 requests customers had. The problem was the first thing had like 90% of the votes. The second thing had just a few and then this third thing almost didn't register. But the way those executives pitched it to leadership was we're building one of the, you know, the top three most wanted things. I was like, well, technically you are. But when no one wants to use it, don't ask me why, because you had your answer from the start, you were just working on something, and you try to justify what you were doing rather than listening to your customers. And that's something I think COVID helped teach that a bit. I think, you know, Amazon, Netflix, all other things people hold up as great customer experience examples. Whether that's directly applicable to your space or not isn't the issue, because I see people saying, well, we're a large, complex, we're ensuring oil rigs. Amazon, one click, that has nothing to do with it. Sure, but all the people that you're engaging with, including yourself, our sense of what a customer experience is has changed. And so. we should be more open to taking that in and looking more critically, and maybe it means getting some outside opinions and outside help but rethinking the art of the possible instead of saying, well, you know, we've always done it this way, or this is a rule. What I love is when people hold up a rule that you must do it this way, and they say why, and I say, well, is that true? Show me the regulation. And what you find quite often is there isn't one. It's already been repealed or replaced. It was something old that, you know, 40 years ago, it was a rule and it's just stayed in kind of the company lore since then. I've gone through this in my own organization. We thought we had to do something on paper. I looked at the regs. We don't. And every time I said we should move to using our mobile app to do this, um, person after person, yeah, but we have to have the paper to give to the regulators. I said, do we, you know, look,</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Ha </p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> We </p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Ha.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> We were shredding the paper when we were done with it. We never gave it to anyone. So. Clearly, we didn't need the paper, but in our minds, it was like, oh, this is a rule, because literally in the 1980s, it was a rule, because there was no other way to do it. So why are we still operating from that place? And that's about humility and a willingness to listen to what your customers are actually telling you and not speaking on their behalf or reinterpreting it in a way that fits your own desires or thoughts better.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Oh, absolutely, and I can totally relate. Yesterday, someone was asking me, you know, what's your success-mantra as an organization? And I was like, it's keeping the clients first. And how we do that is by listening to them. And when we listen to them, we understand their pain points, what they want to achieve as a business or as an individual. And when you know it, then you can plan your solutions around it. But if you want to impose your solutions onto them, it's not going to work on, you know, we're not selling candies. We are not going to have impulsive purchases. You're not selling toys. So, you need to make sure you are working around their problems, their needs, and you're listening to them for your whole year. Otherwise, it's not going to be a long-term relationship with them, and your customers will not be happy. So, I can totally relate. Right. Now we talked about tech, we talked about the customers. Now talent, the employees, so talent acquisition and development are essential for the continued success of any industry. How do you think the insurance sector can attract and retain top talent in an increasingly competitive job?</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> Yeah, and this is mission critical right now. You know, globally, we have an issue where talent is closing in on retirement and we're not filling the pipeline as quickly as we need to. And even if we are, we're not keeping it in the pipeline, which is problematic. So, we can get people in and quickly they find, ah, this isn't what I want it to do. And I think a piece of that comes from the systems, the processes, the tools that we have. If you're 25 years old, are you gonna be willing to put up with that? Are you going to want to work in that way where 53 different tabs are open and you have all these post-it notes with different logins and remember to do this, remember to do that, you're not going to put up with that. Most other jobs you might look at would not require that of you. Just because it's how we've always worked and the people who are closer to retirement are used to it, so they don't think to question it. We have to be willing to look at that. Someone said this really interestingly. She talked about the way that our systems respect our staff. and I've never heard that before, that word respect, is what you're asking that employee to do, respectful of them, their intelligence, their time, their capability, their path. If it's not, they're not gonna stick around. And I think we need to think about that first and foremost. We do need to think about recruitment, and a big piece of that is around the idea that insurance is boring, it's old, it can be those things, but it also, from my experience, is fantastic, fascinating, supportive. Uh, stable insurance can be a wonderful place to build a career with so many different kinds of things you can do, whether it's functional or product or geographic, or a mix of all those things. And I've been really lucky to get to mix across that matrix. That's something that could be appealing to people. And I think ultimately, especially with younger, uh, prospective employees or actual employees, they want purpose. And we hear so much about Gen Z and millennials, they want to know what they're doing matters. If you really stop and think about it, we talk about putting lives back together and insurance. I ran a claims organization. That was the work we did. It's very important and that's the purpose. But go back even deeper than that. If you look around, there is nothing in your life, nothing in the world that happens without insurance behind it. Because the risk of something going bad would stop, and not just thinking about, well, oil tankers and I don't wanna support oil and gas. Fine, what about the solar project? Do you think they can build that without insurance behind it? Do you think</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Right.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> That water project in Africa that's helping, you know, a village that has no clean water, do you think the manufacturing the equipment or that nonprofit or any, none of those things happen without insurance behind it. And so, when you really think about that, it's not just about putting lives together or back together, it's about taking risk off the table so people could live in the first place. And I think that is really profound. If we can harness that instead of, oh, it's boring. And, you know, it's slow. Let's focus on why it really exists. And I think not only do you attract people, but you attract them under the right circumstances, so they're then bought into that mission and they're much more likely to want to climb to the top of that mountain. And I think that's what we need to think about. </p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Wow, wonderful. Yeah, and I know we have touched upon bits and pieces of most of these things. But finally, Bryan, can you share your thoughts on the future of the insurance industry? And what do you think will be the key drivers of change? And how should companies adapt to stay ahead of the...</p></div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> So, some people get frustrated with me that I don't name a lot of specific technologies or technical kind of things. And because I don't think that's the answer, I think there will always be technology. We need to engage with the right ones. And the answer of what's right will be different in different circumstances. So, I don't focus on that. I do think it's about values and culture and how we're willing to engage in it. Are we listening to our customers, our employees? Are we building the right kinds of things for the right reasons? And one of the things I point out a lot is I call it a bank robbery example or analogy. A lot of times in the industry, we look at what we did before and if we're better than that, and then we think that we're good or we're good enough. And I say, if you robbed 12 banks before and you robbed five now, you're better than you were. And a lot of us would pat ourselves and look, look at the progress we've made. You're not supposed to be robbing banks. Let's remember that. So, when we think, look how far we've come, fantastic, celebrated, I'm not against any of that. But just recognize that's not the stopping point. And I think that is where it comes from, is having that humility. As in, the number one leadership quality I look for is humility. I want to see a leader who does not think they're perfect, that they have all the answers, and that there's nothing they could possibly learn. For me, the best jobs I've had have been when I felt like an idiot every day. because I knew there's so much, I didn't know that I'm taking in and it can be exhausting and scary, but it means I'm growing. And it means my skillset is burgeoning and that's what we need as an industry. So having people who are committed to that, willing to listen and learn genuinely and not just paying lip service to it and recognizing we've made great progress, fantastic, good for us. And what if we were even better? Imagine what would happen then. And that's, I think it's that spirit that we need to embrace more as an industry and one that is less protectionist and sort of, you know, self-aggrandizing when maybe we shouldn't be doing that just yet. We're still robbing banks as far as I'm concerned.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> Absolutely, you know, it's like, yeah, I'm moving towards quitting smoking or drinking, but instead of a whole bottle, I do one peg or two peg a day,</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> Right.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> But you're still drinking, you're not sober.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> It's better.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar(KB):</b> So, I can totally understand you want to, you can celebrate that, but it's just a milestone is not the destination itself.</p></div><div class='transcriptLines text-align'><p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Bryan Falchuk:</b> Right.

Joining us is Whitney Carpenter Doig, a true force behind insurance growth, digital leadership, and market expansion.

Beyond her impressive career, Whitney is a thought leader and educator contributing to industry publications and empowering others in the ever-evolving insurance landscape. Today, we dive into Whitney's insights on sales transformation, challenges in the industry, the role of digital platforms, and what the future holds for insurance sales. Whitney, thank you for joining us. </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig:</b> Thank you for that amazing intro, KB. I am truly, truly honored to be here today.</div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> Well, pleasure is all mine. So, let's dive right in. Whitney, in the dynamic world of insurance, sales transformation is a hot topic, you would know. So, can you share your perspective on the key elements that drive successful sales transformation within the industry, and how have you witnessed this unfold in your career? </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig:</b> Yeah, so one of the things I've really noticed as we talk about sales transformation is that the process is different now. So by the time, I get a prospect or client in front of me, they've already done a significant amount of research about what I do, who I am, and what my company does, and they've likely gathered quite a bit of knowledge, whereas before we were the ones holding the power and giving all of the knowledge, but they more times they not show up questions and a pretty good foundation of what we do and if they even want to work with us or not and other companies that they'll be considering too. So, it definitely changes the dynamic of where a prospect is when they get to you. It's not the same as it used to be. They are educating themselves and they're coming to you more prepared than we have seen in the past. So, I think that also puts a responsibility back on us to put out educational content for them to find. So, before we just had to make sure that our pitch was perfected. But now you actually have to be really proactive about putting educational content out for those people to find before they even get to you. I'm a huge fan of using, you know, data analytics to try to figure out where you need to be targeting and innovation and technology to try to give you a boost when you're trying to do those things. But I think it really goes back to you've got to be educating your clients nonstop before they ever even get to have a conversation with you. And I think that is a huge transformation that technology has brought about that maybe we were not completely ready for, but here it is. So, we better figure it out quickly, right? </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> Absolutely, and as a salesperson myself, I can relate to it because, you know, especially in the B2B space, I was reading this study that says that if a prospect is hopping on a call with you, they have already made 70% of their mind whether, </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig:</b> Yeah, </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> They want to go ahead with it or not. And that's based on how you put yourself out there on this internet world. Say, two things, I guess. The good side is that our job is to rest 30% to convert them, which is still a good thing.</p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig:</b> Hahaha </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> Hahaha. But the challenging aspect is how educational content, you know, we are able to put out there, and how consistent we are. It's a change game and I totally agree with you. Thank you for that answer. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig: </b> Yeah, </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> Yeah, moving on to the next one, say, sales, as we know, comes to its own set of challenges from your extensive experience, what challenges have you encountered and how did you navigate them? Any specific strategies that provided instrumental, that proved instrumental in overcoming hurdles and driving positive outcomes? We would love to know. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig: </b> Yeah, I love this question. So, in my industry alone, I heard a statistic that new producers that come in, about 10% are successful. And the rest are not successful. Why is that? Isn't that crazy? That one hits you pretty hard. And in my opinion, staying motivated is really challenging. And that's part of the key. You've got to stay motivated. You've got to teach yourself that you can't take what they're saying personally. You've got to realize It doesn't have anything to do with you. Don't let what they say get you down. Even though it does directly impact you, you can't let it put you in a bad mental space. And so, I always try to say, think of every no as one step closer to a yes. So, you've got to navigate through all the nos to get to the yes, but you've got to stay motivated and celebrate your small wins all throughout that. And one of the things that for me personally, I struggled with that was key in transforming things for me is to come at sales from more of an abundance mindset instead of a scarcity mindset. So, at first, it was like, I have to have all these clients. I have to get every one of them. I can't say no. I can't talk to them because they're going to go away and I have to have them. But when I started thinking about things like, no, I have something really important to offer them. They should want to work with me. And if they walk away, that is 100% okay. I'm going to find another one. That really changed things for me when I shifted, thinking about it from more of an abundance mindset to a scarcity mindset. I think if you can master that, you're going to be miles ahead. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> Wow, it's two key takeaways, an abundance mindset. And I love that every no takes you closer to a yes. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig: </b> Yeah. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> And that's really true. In fact, you know, I tell you what, I personally have stopped thinking of getting sales on a call. So, I go out on a call to have a conversation, to learn about them, </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'> <b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig: </b> Yeah. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'> <b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> To tell them what I do. And in this process, sometimes you make sales, sometimes you don't. But I realized when I looked back at the data, that since I adopted this mindset, my numbers have gone up because I'm not chasing them. I'm just having genuine conversations and truly finding out if my services can help them. So, yeah, I think that that's great. Every no takes you closer to yes. Thank you so much for that. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig: </b> Yeah, and you're developing that genuine connection, which is important too, and I love that. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> Perfect. So yeah, as a seasoned professional, you have been involved in broker and agent education. How can insurance businesses enhance the effectiveness of their brokers and agents to drive better outcomes? Are there specific approaches education-wise or tools that you find particularly impactful? What's your take on that? </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig: </b> Yeah, so before I got into the insurance industry, I was a teacher. So, my soapbox has been and probably always will be an education. I totally believe in educating your clients and your prospects. Educate, educate, educate. But not just on the front end, it's continuous. It's through the entire sales cycle. It's when they become a client. It's when you're maintaining that relationship. It's so important and people respond differently when they understand the why when they understand why are you doing this? Why are you giving me this message? Why is the process like this? Why can you solve my problem? Starting with why it is so important, and it helps to build trust, it helps to maintain trust. And then it allows you to have those tough conversations when you need to because they truly have this understanding because you've been educating them the entire time. I just feel like it's so impactful. And one of the main things to remember when you're educating people is to try to convey the information in different ways because you have different learning styles. Some people need to see it visually. Some people need to hear it with a video or something of that nature. Some people need to write it down. So, I think you've got to get creative and make sure that the way that you're educating people and the way that you're putting out content and information hits multiple different learning styles so that they can consume the information that you're putting out. But I'm a huge believer in educating, learning, and all the things.</p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar:</b> Wow. So, what you're saying is that there cannot be the same yardstick for everyone. There has to be a different style based on how a person absorbs learning, right?</p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig:</b> Yes, absolutely. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'> <b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar:</b> Yeah, and I find that problem a lot of times. Let's say you're using an agency management system, and every agency management system has its own tutorials and videos out there, you know, in their own university world. But when an agent tries to learn from them, they're not able to relate it, because what they're doing is very different from what the agency management system is telling them to do. So, I can totally relate to that. So yeah, great. Not the same yardstick, not always. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig: </b> Yes, I like that phrase. I'm going to have to use that now. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> All yours. Hahaha. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'> <b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig: </b> If you see me with a video and I'm holding a yardstick, you know what's coming. Hahaha. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> I'll be on a watch. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> Cool. So yeah, your expertise spans across multi-line commercial and personal experiences. Could you shed light on how businesses can strategically grow in both these areas? Because we have seen that there are businesses that want to keep a good mix of both. And so, what consideration should leaders keep in mind to balance growth across diverse insurance portfolios? And it can be not just personal and commercial, it can be live, it can be benefits, or a good mix of everything. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig: </b> Yeah, I think diversification is huge. So, I say try to offer a diverse range of products that can attract a broad customer base. And then that's also going to boost your retention because the more touch points you have with that client, the stickier they'll be if you will. So like if you're already writing commercial insurance, maybe you need to look at more specialized coverages. So, you may be writing those commercial policies, but maybe consider adding cyber or professional liability. I was listening to a podcast yesterday on professional liability and how important it is and how there are so many out there that it doesn't quite click how important that can be. That's a great way to diversify. Or maybe you get into a niche industry where you focus on a specific industry and diversify your book in that way by adding some specialized business into your book. I mean, you can always cross-sell, right? Everybody wants to talk about the power of cross-selling. So, you can use that to your advantage. But what about data? I feel like we should be looking at data and analytics tools to be able to tell us where we should be diversifying our books. And what are our customers doing and how can you improve customer engagement? Where should you be targeting? If you're not effectively using your data, what are you even doing? It can really drive so much of your action that it could be hugely, hugely meaningful. And then I think it's important to build your relationships also, relationships are going to help you diversify as well. So that's not just relationships with your clients. I'm talking about another business owner with industry associations with your chambers of commerce, just really getting those relationships really broad across a diverse group is going to be helpful, too. And then I say invest in technology also, like what can you do from an AI perspective maybe to help you accomplish those goals too, and then just continuing to change and adapt to what the market is bringing your way. It's tough. but it's completely doable. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar:</b> Yeah, lots of insights there. And I also totally agree that let's say I'm doing a commercial, and if I'm focusing on only just one aspect of the commercial, I might be missing out on a lot of other things. And what happens in that scenario is, let's say one of my existing customers' needs cyber as well, or maybe professional, and I do not have that, they will go out to a different vendor. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig: </b> They will </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> And if they like it better, you know, I might lose the business. So yeah, at least even if they do not diversify a lot, I think they should have complementary and supplementary products so that their client can have everything from you versus, </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig:</b> Yeah, </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> You know, managing multiple brokers and agents, which is,</p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig:</b> Yeah, completely. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> A painful experience to have. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig: </b> It is that you can make their life easier, and it benefits you all at the same time.</p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> Great. So, you talked about, you touched upon relationships, so let's talk a bit about it. So, building and maintaining a relationship is a critical aspect of sales. In your role as a regional vice president with SIAA, how do you approach relationship leadership, especially in the context of driving sales growth? Any lessons learned that you could share with our audience, please?</p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig: </b> Hahaha, so this is one of my favorite topics, as you probably know. Of course, I'm going to say be authentic, right? Just show up as your true authentic self. And I try to do this in every new relationship. I show up as 100% authentic Whitney. And I just find that I'm able to build trust so much faster than I would if I were playing the typical sales, if you will, game. But when I just show up and I'm me, I'm open, I'm transparent in communication, I try to show empathy and really build a genuine connection with them, it really, for me anyways, changes the whole process. It makes it so good, so good. You would think that just that one thing people want authentic connection. And I've said this before, there was actually a study that they put out that's called the Spain Scale, where they took about 25,000 people, put them in a room, and the purpose was to measure the power of the emotions that they were feeling. And you would think that love was the most powerful emotion that a human felt, but it actually isn't. It's authenticity. That right there is power. That is mind-blowing to think that you could have so much power just by showing up as your true authentic self when you're building relationships with clients and other business professionals. It's really powerful.</p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> Wow, so in a way, when you are being authentic, you're already creating that trust factor. So even if they may not need your services, when they do, or if they do know someone who needs it, they will remember you because you were true ‘You’ when you were presenting yourself in the services. Well, being authentic. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig: </b> Yeah, yeah, they don't feel like you're just trying to sell them. And I feel like that really changes things. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> Absolutely, Wonderful. Say, again, coming back to the insurance world, the insurance industry is ever-evolving. How do successful professionals adapt to changes in the industry, especially in the context of sales, I think insurance for agencies is all about sales. Retention comes after it, but if you have to survive and grow, sales are a must-have. So, are there any certain mindset shifts or strategies that you believe are crucial for navigating the dynamic nature of the insurance business? </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig: </b> Yeah, I think you really have to embrace technology. Like, we're talking about this today because we've seen a wave of digital transformation, and professionals have to be able to leverage these types of tools to stay competitive, or they will no longer be competitive. So, maybe they actually use a CRM to manage their client relationships instead of... an Excel spreadsheet, which we all so love, but maybe it's time to do something different. Or you're using data analytics tools to understand your customer's behavior better, or learning about emerging things like Insurtech that could be beneficial for you as well. So, I think if we're not embracing technology that we're missing in a way that is going to be detrimental at some point, maybe not right away, but at some point, if you're not embracing technology and doing the whole digital transformation thing, it's going to come back in a negative way. I think that we've got to be flexible and resilient because as you're changing things and trying to do things a different way, you're going to come into challenges, but you're also going to find opportunities. So, you've just got to continue to be flexible and be open to pivoting what you're doing and trying it in a different way so that you can find the thing that's going to help you succeed and differentiate you. And then I think one of the huge parts is to maintain a customer-centric approach. Like remember that they are your goal you need to bring value to them, really understand their needs, and be able to meet those needs. And I feel like professionals, sales professionals who really keep this at the forefront of their strategy, remembering why they're showing up on a daily basis, despite the industry challenges are going to be successful at the end of the day because they're really rooted in who they're showing up for and what the mission is. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> Right. I think this is great advice, technology, and client-centricity. I was talking to a customer yesterday. So, the client again is a Canada-based agency. And I asked this question. So, what's your sales strategy? You know, the top one. And he said something very unique. He said client retention. And I couldn't relate for a second. So, I asked, you know, what? How client retention is retention, not a sales strategy. He says, I tried performance campaigns and per lead cost is way too high to even reach break-even in the next three or four months. So, if I keep my current clients happy, my referral business shoots up. So that's his strategy and I couldn't agree more. That's the best strategy to have.</p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig: </b> Yeah.</p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> You can make each of your customers your brand ambassador. I think that's the best ready one can have. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig: </b> How big is that? I mean, and so meaningful when you've got people talking about you and talking about how well you do things and why they should do business with you, and then you don't have to establish that credibility. It's already there. I think that that's a great strategy. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> Absolutely. Wow. Great. So yeah, moving on to the next one. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig: </b> Hehehe </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> Sales and business development often go hand in hand. From your experience, how can businesses create a synergy between sales efforts and overall business development strategies, or is there a delicate balance that needs to be maintained? And if so, how do you strike?</p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig: </b> Yeah, so I think that when we are in this space, everybody, and I've said this earlier, everybody has to be aligned with the ‘Why’. Everybody has to be working towards the same mission, really understand that mission, and have objectives that are lined up with that mission. If anybody's off, it's kind of like I was using this example the other day. When people run in military style, you know where they're running in the line and then the person in the back has to move to the front, and they have to keep everybody going and support everyone on the same level, I think that can translate, right? We've all got to be aligned. We've all got to be pushing and pulling in the same direction or it's going to cause problems. If they, if everyone doesn't understand how their role at that company contributes to the mission. You're going to find huge misalignment. So, I think that there needs to be conversations about strategy, sharing insights and experiences, and really being intentional about making sure that everyone is aligned with the company mission and the company initiatives. I just recently learned about project boards, like shared project boards. I think those are so great for keeping everybody aligned. And, you know, why are, it seems like it's all the tech companies that are using those. Why aren't we all using these cool little boards that can make sure that we're all aligned, like a visual to keep us all on track, a target that we're heading towards? I think that everybody has to be aligned with the mission, know their why, and know how they impact that specifically with what they do. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> Yeah, and I like the power of visuals for alignment. I think that can be great and huge because that way everyone is literally on the same page. Yeah. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig: </b> Yeah.</p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> Hahaha, great. So, looking ahead, what trends do you foresee shaping the future of insurance sales? Are there any emerging technologies we talked about technology a lot. So, are there any emerging technologies or industry shifts that insurance professionals should keep a close eye on and can stay ahead of the curve? </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig: </b> Yeah, so I'm a huge fan of AI. I just love it. I love the potential that's there for AI. And I think that that's a trend that we're going to see helping the industry in many different ways. And that's going to continue to expand as we go. So, I think about streamlining processes, helping us make better business decisions, helping underwriters make more informed decisions, and portfolio management. Even if you're thinking about an agent quoting an account, if they could have AI that's suggesting, typically companies with this code are concerned about this type of coverage, have you considered that? I mean, I really think that the sky's the limit with AI. And definitely something, a space that I want to be in and watch the whole time because I think it's really going to be transformative. Let's see. I've talked about data analytics, too. And I really feel like that's going to remain a player for the long term. It's not going anywhere, but the challenge is learning how to effectively use the data in a good way. You can have a ton of data, but if you're not using it in a good way, it's not going to do you any good. So, I really think that we need to use data to help us dig into customer behavior and market trends to assess risk and maybe even develop better sales strategies, really digging into the data that we have and using it to our advantage. And then I think we're going to continue to see stuff from InterTECH companies. I think that they're going to be around and that there's potential to really see growth there and to see some companies in space doing some pretty cool things. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> Wow, what's your favorite AI? </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig: </b> Oh, I mean, I love all AIs. How are you even supposed to pick? I mean, I learn more and more every day. I learned about Gemini this morning and I've never used it, but that's one that I want to go and check out now because I just keep learning. I think every time I talk to you, I learn about a new AI option, and I'm always really impressed by all of them. I don't know if I could pick a favorite. I love them all. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> No, but Gemini is good. I think the new version is fantastic and it gives you a lot without the cost. So, I think it's a great option for everyone to use, especially when you want to do some research work. I think that that's a great tool to have.</p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig: </b> Yeah. And one of the things that I learned that I didn't know that I actually learned from you is when you're getting stuff from AI and you don't feel like it's the kind of quality that you want, you can actually teach. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'> <b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> Yes. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig: </b> Teach it things. And then you'll get better results. That blew my mind. And yeah, so I've been using that religiously ever since you taught me that. Teach AI. There you go, educate. Hahaha. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> I will tell you one secret about that one. Say, in our team, we all share the entire day's major updates, you know, that happen throughout the day so that everyone is aware of what's going on with everyone. But, you know, I'm a lazy person by nature. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> Hahaha </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig: </b> Hahaha</p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> So, writing the detailed stuff was pretty boring for me. So, what I did was I trained ChatGPT, sharing how I write, and what kind of reports I write. And then at the day's end, what I do now is just share the pointers and it creates a beautiful one-pager for me that </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig: </b> Wow. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> That's what your entire day looks like. It mimics my language and is just an enhanced version of it. And the use cases are enormous. I think it's limitless. It's based on how far you can imagine, and it will have the solution for you. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig: </b> Yeah, absolutely. Oh, I love that little tip.</p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> Haha, great, so before we wrap up, we would like to end on a lighter note. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig: </b> Hehehe </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig: </b> Oh, my goodness. This is a tough one, a fictional character. You know, I don't know that it's necessarily a fictional character, but I've always wanted to be an underwriter that was like underwriting a football player's thighs. Like, how do you decide what that football player's thighs are worth and ensure that type of thing? I think that's so interesting. And when you're talking about fictional characters, you could go to the ones that are always in trouble and always causing problems and getting injured and all the things they're going to need work comp and crime, all kinds of stuff. They're going to be breaking into states. And I think that that's such an interesting question. So, I don't know if I have a specific one. We could just go with like your traditional bad guy slash superhero, I think that okay, maybe they wouldn't be the hero if they're the bad guy, but they still have all the powers, and they're doing things like robbing things and breaking into say things. Hahaha. And burning stuff down. Hahaha. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> Hahaha. Excellent choice, excellent choice. And I think our listeners would love to see the terms and conditions of that one. Hahaha.</p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Whitney Carpenter Doig: </b> Right? I feel like that could be an interesting little LinkedIn series for you to come up with coverages and for all the different kinds of characters that you create. I love that. </p> </div> <div class='transcriptLines text-align'> <p class='my-2 transcriptLines text-align'><b class='text-black'>Kuldeep Bhatnagar: </b> Hahaha.
